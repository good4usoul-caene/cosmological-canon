# Author: TTRPG- Copilot Agent
# User-Request: "Add diagnostic workflows before PR" / "Add permissions for writing contents and creating pull requests"
# Purpose: Create or update files under /TTRPG/Heretics/, push to branch ttrpg/setup-templates, and open a Pull Request.
# Notes:
#  - Uses secrets.ALL_SOULS_TOKEN for authenticated push & PR creation.
#  - Detects repository default branch (origin/HEAD) and uses it as PR base.
#  - Idempotent branch handling so repeated runs are safe.
#  - Commits only when changes exist and only pushes if commit succeeds.
#  - Retries pushes and PR creation to handle transient failures.

🔮 PC Hooks: The Four Defiers of the Singular Gaze

🧙‍♂️ 1. The Wizard: Archivist of Forbidden Names  
Origin: Discovered a codex beneath the collapsed temple containing erased divine names. Belief Status: Agnostic, seeking proof through arcane logic. Conflict: Each name invoked risks divine punishment—but also unlocks forgotten power. Arc: Must decide whether to restore the pantheons or prove Pascal’s God is the only one. 

⚔️ 2. The Fighter: Blade of the Broken Oath — Corra Voss  
Origin: Wields a weapon forged from shattered divine covenants. Belief Status: Disillusioned believer, once loyal to Pascal’s God. Conflict: The blade grows stronger when oaths are broken, but hungers for divine blood. Arc: Must choose whether to restore the original oath or forge a new divine pact. 

🌿 3. The Druid: Grovekeeper of Converging Realms  
Origin: Secret guardian of the last living grove, which blooms across multiple pantheons. Belief Status: Heretic, believes the grove itself is divine. Conflict: The grove is regularly cleared of heretics by the Clerisy of the Gaze. Arc: Must decide whether to open the grove to all or seal it from divine war.

🪓 4. The Barbarian: Vessel of the Forgotten God  
Origin: Possessed by a god whose name was erased from all pantheons. Belief Status: Apostate, seeks to destroy Pascal’s God. Conflict: Rage is divine, but uncontrollable. The god within may be more dangerous than the one above. Arc: Must choose whether to become the god’s avatar or purge it from existence. 

🎼 5. The Bard: Voice of the Forbidden Hymn  
Origin: Raised in the Choir of the Gaze, trained to sing only of Pascal’s glory. But one day, the bard heard a melody in a dream—an ancient hymn from a forgotten god. Belief Status: Torn between indoctrination and inspiration. Conflict: Their voice can stir divine memory in others, awakening suppressed pantheons. But each performance risks damnation. Arc: Must choose whether to become a prophet of polyphony or silence the forbidden song forever.

🙏 6. The Cleric: Apostate of the Dual Flame  
Origin: Once a devout servant of Pascal’s God, the cleric now secretly communes with two exiled deities—one of mercy, one of wrath. Belief Status: Apostate, but still haunted by the fear of hell. Conflict: Their miracles flicker between Pascal’s sanctioned light and the dual flame of rebellion. Arc: Must decide whether to renounce Pascal entirely, reconcile the flames, or become a martyr.

🕵️ 7. The Rogue: Whisperer of the Shimmering Veil  
Origin: Discovered the shifting boundary to the Grove of Converging Realms and now acts as a smuggler of divine relics and forbidden truths. Belief Status: Cynical opportunist, believes in gods only as leverage. Conflict: The rogue is hunted by the Clerisy, but protected by the Grove—so long as they don’t betray it. Arc: Must choose whether to sell the Grove’s secrets, protect its sanctity, or become its unseen guardian. 

⚖️ 8. The Paladin: Oathbound to the Silent Throne  
Origin: Swore an oath to Pascal’s God in youth, believing in the promise of eternal heaven. But now, the paladin has seen the throne—and it is silent, unmoving, unfeeling. Belief Status: Disillusioned, but still bound by divine contract. Conflict: Their oath grants power, but also chains. Breaking it may unleash divine wrath—or divine freedom. Arc: Must decide whether to uphold the oath, rewrite it, or shatter it and face the consequences.

# Aldra Vey — Archivist of Forbidden Names (NPC Wizard, L1-ish)
