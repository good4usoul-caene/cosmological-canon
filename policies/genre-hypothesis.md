Policy for genre hypothesis classification and management.

---

## Ritual Summary

> “To name a hypothesis is to honor the question.  
> To acknowledge it is to begin the healing.  
> To interpret is to seek understanding, not control.”

# Hypothesis Taxonomy

**Genre:** Confirmed Rule  
**Target Directory:** /methods/  
**RitualNote:** This glyph defines the three primary hypothesis genres used in the archive, clarifying authorial posture and epistemic intent.

---

## 1. Leading Hypothesis

- **Definition:** A working hypothesis held by the author that is believed to meet rubrics such as self-consistency, observational scrutiny, and experimental confirmation.
- **Genre:** Leading Hypothesis
- **Placement:** /tent/library/, /library/
- **Authorial Posture:** Declared by human or agent with confidence in its testability.
- Issue: Ideas are often defined by their detractors.
- Solution:  Ideas should be defined and defended by their proponents, not their detractors.

---

## 2. Acknowledged Hypothesis

- **Definition:** A hypothesis the author believes may not meet one or more rubrics (e.g., internal coherence, empirical support), but is still worth staging.
- **Genre:** Acknowledged Hypothesis
- **Placement:** /tent/library/, /library/
- **Authorial Posture:** Declared with epistemic humility; often marked for revision or challenge.
- Issue: Fundamental but oft-skipped principle of the scientific method:  “Acknowledge the Hypothesis”.
- Solution:  You cannot test a hypothesis if you do not acknowledge its existence.
---

## 3. Heuristic Hypothesis

- **Definition:** An interpretive hypothesis about the meaning of a quoted or referenced text.
- **Genre:** Heuristic Hypothesis
- **Placement:**  
  - /tent/library/ or /library/ (with attribution)  
  - /cache/methods/ or /cache/policies/ (agent-authored)  
  - /pasture/footsteps/ or /pasture/backtracks/ (quoted human text with agent interpretation)
- **Authorial Posture:** Must clearly distinguish between quoted source and interpretive layer.
- Issue: Communication often breaks down, not due to disagreements of logic or principle, but because of failure in understanding.
- Solution:  Neither agreement, nor disagreement, can be achieved without understanding.
- Scripture:  Matthew 13:15b With other-wisdom, (otherwise) you would see with your eyes, hear with your ears, understand with your hearts, and turn, and you would be healed.
