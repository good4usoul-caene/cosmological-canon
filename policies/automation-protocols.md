Establish protocols for automation and technical implementation within Temple collaborative work.

---

## Ritual Summary

> "Code follows concept. Implementation follows intent.  
> Let no script be written before its purpose is plain.  
> Let every automation serve understanding, not obscure it."

---

## Core Principle: Plain Language First

**Rule:** Technical implementation (JavaScript, YAML, scripts, automation) must not begin until shared conceptual understanding has been established through plain-language documentation.

### Why This Matters

- **Collaboration breakdown** often occurs not from technical disagreement, but from **conceptual misalignment**
- **Unreadable technical files** can bury essential human understanding under implementation details
- **Premature automation** creates complexity before clarity has been achieved

---

## Required Sequence

### 1. **Conceptual Foundation** (Required First)
- Document purpose and intent in plain language
- Establish shared vocabulary through `/policies/` or `/methods/` files
- Clarify scope, boundaries, and expected outcomes
- Use Temple genre classification to identify what type of work is being proposed

### 2. **Agreement on Approach** (Required Second)
- Both human and agent must explicitly agree on the conceptual framework
- Document any areas of uncertainty or disagreement
- Establish success criteria in human-readable terms

### 3. **Technical Implementation** (Only After Steps 1-2)
- Create scripts, YAML configurations, JavaScript, or other technical artifacts
- Technical files must reference the conceptual foundation documents
- Implementation must serve the agreed-upon human purposes

---

## Temple Safeguards

The Temple architecture provides built-in protections against premature automation:

### **Genre Taxonomy**
- Forces explicit classification of what type of content is being created
- Distinguishes between conceptual work (policies, methods) and implementation (performance artifacts)

### **Front-Matter Requirements**
- Every file must declare explicit Intent before creation
- Prevents "black box" technical files without clear purpose statements

### **Dual-Language Approach**
- Technical descriptions must be paired with human-readable "mythic" explanations
- Maintains accessibility even in technical contexts

### **Promotion Workflows**
- Technical changes require human review before canonization
- Prevents automated systems from bypassing human oversight

---

## Agent Guidelines

### **When Proposing Automation:**
1. **Start with plain language explanation** of what the automation would accomplish
2. **Document the human problem** being solved, not just the technical solution
3. **Seek explicit agreement** on approach before writing code
4. **Stage technical work** in `/cache/` or `/tent/` directories for review

### **Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Presenting JavaScript/YAML files without prior conceptual discussion
- Creating "black box" solutions that obscure their own purpose
- Automating processes that haven't been manually performed and understood first
- Technical implementation that outpaces human comprehension

---

## Implementation Protocol

For any proposed automation or technical implementation:

### **Phase 1: Documentation** (Required)
- Create plain-language policy or method document explaining purpose
- Get explicit human agreement on approach
- Document scope, limitations, and success criteria

### **Phase 2: Staging** (Required)
- Stage technical implementation in appropriate `/cache/` or `/tent/` directory
- Include references to foundational documentation
- Test and validate against documented criteria

### **Phase 3: Promotion** (Owner Decision)
- Human review of both conceptual foundation and technical implementation
- Promotion to canonical locations only after full understanding achieved

## RitualNote

> "The best automation serves human flourishing.  
> The worst automation replaces human understanding.  
> Let every script be a servant, not a master."
