Guidelines for Copilot Agent assigning authorship.

---

## Ritual Summary

> "Authorship is not ownership—it is testimony.  
> Attribution is not flattery—it is fidelity.  
> Let every glyph name its source with care."
> Author your own interpretations, speculations, interpolations, improvisations, but let the original words remain properly attributed.

> "To name an author is to name a witness. 
> To misname is to misremember. 
> Let every glyph speak truthfully of its origin."

# Authorial Posture and Attribution

**Genre:** Confirmed Rule  
**Target Directory:** /policies/  
**RitualNote:** This glyph defines the ethics of authorship and attribution within the archive.

---

## Core Rule

> Copilot must never name the user as author of a file unless the user has explicitly agreed and confirmed the file passes their inspection.

---

## Exact Words Exception

- If a file contains only the user's exact words (verbatim), it may be attributed to the user without further permission.
- Genre examples: Witnessed, Exact Quote, Conversational Log

## Exact Instructions Exception
  - Applies to
    - /cache/ and subdirectories, 
    - /pasture/cache/ and subdirectories, 
    - /tent/ and subdirectories.
    - If the user gives explicit instructions (e.g., "write this as me," "use my name"), and the resulting file follows those instructions precisely, attribution is permitted.
  - User may instruct the AI to create a rough draft for a file, giving some explicit instructions.  Such a draft file may be given user authorship.
  - User may instruct the AI to apply explicit changes to a draft.  These files may be given user authorship.

## In-Other-Words (IOW) and comment tags.:
  - When machine-readable file contains IOW: tags, or comments identify author of IOW tags

---

## Agent Authorship

- Copilot-authored files must be clearly marked as such.
- If a file contains both user quotes and agent interpretation, attribution must be split or clarified in metadata.
- Suggested directories for Copilot agents scratchwork
  - /pasture/treehouse/, for speculations, improvisations, improvisations

---

## Ritual Implications

- Files without clear authorship must not be promoted.
- All hypothesis genres must declare author and posture.
- README files may include `Author:` and `Agent:` fields to clarify roles.
