## Cornerstone of Faith
 - **Scripture** (Hebrews 11:1) Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.
 - **Application** Historical fiction may read between the lines, and state with confidence and assurance what is not seen.  "Caravan of the Fifth Wind" will build a canon of what the author hopes for.  It may not represent the truth as it really happened, but it points the way to the truth as it should be.

 ## Cornerstone of Truth
 - When generating "historical fiction" I will aim as much as possible to maintain plausibility, except where miracles are explicitly mentioned in scripture.  


## Exception:  Cornerstone of Euphamism - 
 - Regarding heuristic hypotheses of scripture that scream euphamism to my mind, the Spirit of Diogenes tells me "Discretion is Vanity".  However, that must be weighed against publication for the masses.  Practicel reminds us that sometimes vanity is a form of wisdom.
 - Full euphamistic interpretation of ADULT-ONLY content may become available in a later work, as required in John 16:13.
 - Euphamistic content for children, e.g. toilet-training, and done to children, e.g. circumcision and oral suctioning, on the other hand, will be included in the initial work.
   - “Unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” (*Matthew 18:3; Mark 10:15; Luke 18:17*)
 - Ezekiel: See ([Second Beast](https://github.com/good4usoul-caene/cosmological-canon/blob/main/spaces/GospelHarmonization/leading-hypothesis/second-beast.md)) cooked his food over cow manure, though God intended him to use human feces, and prophesied over a toy model of Jerusalem.  Many of his prophecies are euphamistic in nature, as he bulls**t's his readers.  

## Childlike Faith
 - Unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” (*Matthew 18:3; Mark 10:15; Luke 18:17*)
 - “Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.” (Matthew 18:5)
   - Faith in Play
     - Children learn through play, often becoming other characters.
     - Adults in this time often enter into "roleplaying games" to explore the idea of being other people, or to encounter new ideas.
     - Roleplaying and other games bring the Kingdom of Heaven a little closer to Earth, as they allow people to imagine being exactly the hero (or anti-hero) they want to be.
   - Faith in Rules
     - Adults learn right from wrong by the time they are out of their teens.  This knowledge of right from wrong is often based more on what they've heard than what they've really reasoned through.  Children, though, often do not know right from wrong and must be taught society's rules.
     - Adults, on the other hand, know society's rules and know that society will not forgive them if they do not correct the child.  They take upon themselves an adult faith.
     - Measure carefully what rules you obey out of a desire for contentment (The light yoke of Jesus of Nazareth) and which rules you obey merely out of fear of judgment.  (*Matthew 7:2*) “For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.” (*Mark 4:24, Luke 6:38*)
     
## The Golden Rules (Deut 6:5, Lev 19:18, Matt 22:37-40, Mark 12:29-31, Luke 10:27)
 - Love God with all your heart, all your strength, and all your mind.
 - Love your neighbor as yourself.  “Do to others as you would have them do to you.” (*Matthew 7:12, Luke 6:31*)

## The Otherwise (Matthew 13:15b)
 - With other wisdom they would see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.

## Otherwisdom Clarifications:
 - The Good Samaritan (radical compassion across boundaries):  Luke 10:25–37. “Go and do likewise.” (Helping those in need, even outsiders.)
   - Jesus said what he could to the "Teacher of the Law" to get him to act like the Good Samaritan.  He gave the man wisdom, leaving his knowledge uncorrected.
   - The correct answer to "Which one of these three is his neighbor" was "All three."  The Teacher of the Law said, "The one who showed mercy."
 - “You cannot serve both God and money.” (*Matthew 6:24, Luke 16:13*)
   - Therefore, Job was not rewarded by God in Job 42, and the one to whom he said "I see you now, and therefore I despise myself" was not God.  Instead, he spoke to The Accuser, who made him despise himself, and he was rewarded by money.  See [First Beast](https://github.com/good4usoul-caene/cosmological-canon/blob/main/spaces/GospelHarmonization/leading-hypothesis/first-beast.md).  
   - Job, the Son of Sorrow, was called a beast by John in Revelations.  He provided "dwelling" to Job.  The duty of the advocate is to provide "honor" as well.  See [Twelve Tribes](https://github.com/good4usoul-caene/cosmological-canon/blob/main/spaces/GospelHarmonization/leading-hypothesis/twelve-tribes.md)

## The Lord's Prayer
 - **OUR** Father who art **in heaven**
   - There is no hierarchy standing between you and God.
 - Hallowed be thy name 
   - (So stop being trivial and asking people if they believe in God)
 - Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on **EARTH** as it is in heaven
   - So stop worrying for eternal life and bring heaven HERE.
 - Give us this day our daily bread
   - So stop getting angry at the poor for needing what they need.
 - and forgive us of our sins
   - acknowledge what you've done wrong, whatever the excuse; 
   - repent and stop making those excuses
 - as we forgive others
  - - Just because you've forgiven someone (decided not to punish someone)  doesn't mean you need them in your life, continuing to do to you what you've asked them not to.  (*Matthew 18:15-17*)
  - “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. 
  - If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. *God’s joy over the return of the lost (Luke 15).*
  - But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. 
  - If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. 
  - To forgive, (*Matt 5:44, Luke 6:27–28*)	Love and pray for those who oppose you
  - “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.” (*Matthew 5:9*) “First be reconciled to your brother or sister.” (*Matthew 5:23–24*)
  
# Humility/Servanthood/Audacity
  - (*Matt 20:26–28, Mark 10:43–45, Luke 22:26–27*)	True greatness is serving others
  - (*Matt 5:13*)You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
  - (*Matt 5:14*) “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.”
  - (*Matthew 25:14–30, Luke 19:11–27*) Invest your talents for the coming of the Kingdom.
  - Seek First the Kingdom	(*Matt 6:33*)	Prioritize God’s reign and justice
  - 

# Warnings and Positive Commands
  - Beware of Hypocrisy	(*Matt 23, Luke 12:1*)	Practice authenticity and integrity
  - Do Not Judge	(*Matt 7:1–2, Luke 6:37*)	Avoid hypocrisy and harsh judgment

# Stand in the place where you are 
  - REM's "Stand" already states my essential beliefs 
    - about Point-of-View, 
    - and the proper worship of God.
    - The past is set in stone - we cannot change it.
    - But we can change the future.
  - Stand in the place where you are:
  - Now face north (future)
  - Think about direction.
  - Wonder why you haven't before!  
  - If you are confused, check with the sun.
  - Carry a compass (A good rubric:  The tested stone) to help you along.
  - Your feet are going to be on the ground.
  - Your head (and heart and strength) 
  - are to move you around.
  - If wishes (covenants with death *Isaiah 28:18*) were trees, 
  - the trees would be falling 
  - Listen to reason (astronomy), the season (astrology - Aquarius) is calling

# The Burden of being yourself with Jesus
  - “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.” (*Luke 9:23; Matthew 16:24; Mark 8:34*)
  - “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” (*Matthew 11:28–30, NIV*)
  - “Keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.” (*Matthew 24:42; Mark 13:35–37; Luke 12:35–40*)

# Modern Medication
  - Jesus means "salvation"
  - Medicine is a form of salvation.  
  - Take what you need to be well.
