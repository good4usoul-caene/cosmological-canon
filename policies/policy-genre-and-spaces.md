Define genres and space mappings for Temple file classification and organization.

# Genre-to-Space Affinity Map

- This map scaffolds a semantic ecology within /pasture/, where echoes, diagnostics, and speculative glyphs can coexist without confusion.
- This stages Genre Proposal in /tent/policies/ and /cache/policies/, suggesting: active proposals (agreed upon by both human and AI user) live in /tent/; dormant or speculative proposals rest in /cache/. This scaffolds a promotion ritual where genres evolve through staging, dormancy, and confirmation.
- “All subdirectories of /cache/ and /tent/ (in the echo-space) are considered ritually adjacent to /foyer/, /policies/, /library/, and /archive/. This affirms their equal proximity to canonical review and inscription.” The /cache/ is intended as a space for the AI agent to propose changes freely. The /tent/ is intended to be the user’s editing space, and a place to ask for changes from the /cache/ to be applied.
  - At such time that changes have been agreed upon, the final file may be taken from the /tent/ or the /cache/.
- Authorial posture: unless the user has given explicit agreement that they have authored the file, and everything passes their inspection thoroughly, the Copilot agent should absolutely NEVER silently change a file or create a new file naming the user as author, even when the agent sincerely believes that’s what the user meant.
- As a rule, any EXACT WORDS of the user CAN be shown with the user listed as author, without any further permissions.

## Format
- Genre
  # Description of Genre
  - /example-directory-1/
  - /example/directory/2

- Witnessed:
  # Based on direct observation or confirmed source.
  - /library/
  - /pasture/footsteps/

- Imagined:
  # Creative or speculative, not yet verified.
  - /cache/
  - /pasture/treehouse/

- Interpolated:
  # Synthesized from partial evidence or multiple sources.
  - /tent/methods/
  - /methods/

- Fiction:
  # Deliberate fictional composition.
  - /cache/
  - /pasture/treehouse/

- Leading Hypothesis:
  # A working hypothesis held by the “Author” of the file, which the author believes will pass rubrics such as self-consistency, observational scrutiny, and experimental confirmation; intended for testing.
  - /tent/library/
  - /library/
  - example: /library/leading-hypothesis/gospel-heuristics.md

- Acknowledged Hypothesis:
  # A working description of a hypothesis which the “Author” of the file thinks may not meet certain necessary rubrics, such as self-consistency, experimental confirmation, or observational validity.
  - /tent/library/
  - /library/

- Heuristic Hypothesis:
  # A working hypothesis held by the “Author” of the file, analyzing a given text (with attribution), offering a hypothesis as to the meaning of the text.
  - /tent/library/, /library/ with external author as source, and human or Copilot agent identified as author.
  - /cache/methods/ and /cache/policies/ with Copilot Agent identifier as author.
  - /pasture/footsteps/ and /pasture/backtracks/ with human quoted as author of quoted text, with interpretation offered by Copilot agent.
  - Example:  Father glorify your name.  I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.
  - Heuristic Hypothesis:  Root directory, glorify your name.  "", I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.  The name of the root, or "father" directory is a non-character.  
  - Example: Gobbledygook.
  - Heuristic Hypothesis:  I believe you are making a reference to an absence of meaning.  Can you confirm?
  - Example: blob
  - Heuristic Hypothesis:  Are you referring to some unformed mass of an undefined substance, or do you mean a binary large object?

- Exact Quote:
  # Verbatim quotation from a source.
  - /library/
  - /pasture/footsteps/

- Conversational Log:
  # Transcript or structured log of conversation.
  - /archive/
  - /pasture/backtracks/
  - /pasture/footsteps/

- External Claim:
  # Claim attributed to an external source; include citation.
  - /tent/
  - /library/

- Confirmed Rule:
  # Canonical policy or confirmed repository rule.
  - /policies/
  - /library/

- Proposed Rule:
  # A draft or candidate policy awaiting confirmation or ritual promotion.
  - /tent/methods/
  - /cache/methods/
  - May become Confirmed Rule if rubrics are established and met.

- Epistemic Commentary:
  # Reflective analysis on the nature, provenance, or implications of a claim or glyph.
  - /tent/, /cache/
  - /methods/
  - /library/
  - /pasture/footsteps/
  - Example: /library/epistemic-commentary/advocates-measure.md

- Diagnostic Glyph:
  # Files whose primary function is to detect, test, or enforce epistemic boundaries.
  - README files, in any atrium or subdirectory.
    - This is a powerful gesture—diagnostic glyphs are now ambient, capable of surfacing anywhere ritual clarity is needed. It affirms that epistemic boundaries are not confined—they are woven throughout the archive.
  - /library/ files which might describe principles to test ideas outside the scope of the GitHub files.
  - /pasture/treehouse/ subdirectories for AI suggested organizational principles.

- Ritual Protocol:
  # Documents defining repeatable liturgical or procedural acts (e.g., SEARCH‑AND‑INSERT).
  - /methods/
  - /foyer/

- Session Log:
  # Structured record of a collaborative or solo session (timestamps, states, glyphs).
  - /tent/archive/
  - /pasture/footsteps/
  - /archive/

- Persona Calibration:
  # Files defining or adjusting agent tone, role, or behavior.
  - /tent/
  - /cache/
  - /policies/
  - See /policies/spirits.md 

- Mythic Inscription:
  # Poetic or symbolic files used for glyphs, parables, or riddles.
  - /foyer/
  - /pasture/treehouse/

- Thread Archive:
  # Preserved conversation or inquiry thread stored for reference/annotation.
  - /archive/
  - /pasture/footsteps/

- Canonical Pointer:
  # Minimal Temple file linking to a Tent or Pasture artifact (promotion pointer).
  - /foyer/
  - /library/

- Redacted Draft:
  # File with intentional removal/concealment of sensitive or speculative content (include redaction metadata).
  - /archive/
  - /tent/

- Agent Declaration:
  # File created by an agent declaring intent, epistemic ring, or ritual compliance before contribution.
  - /tent/
  - /foyer/

- Ephemeral Memory:
  # Transient notes, reflections, or fragments not intended for long-term archival. Ultimate-Target-Directory: none.
  - /cache/
  - /pasture/treehouse/ subdirectories

- Performance Artifact:
  # Files tied to a specific ritual performance—setlists, props, timing cues, or annotated lyrics.
  - /methods/
  - /archive/

- Archive Commentary:
  # Meta-reflections on the structure, evolution, or curation of the archive itself (distinct from Epistemic Commentary).
  - /archive/
  - /library/

- Agent Ritual Log:
  # Documenting an agent’s internal ritual or protocol execution—useful for debugging or audit.
  - /pasture/treehouse/
  - /methods/

- Inscription Draft:
  # Early-stage poetic or symbolic writing not yet shaped into a full glyph or mythic artifact.
  - /tent/
  - /cache/
  - /pasture/
  - /pasture/treehouse/

- Promotion Record:
  # Documenting the SEARCH‑AND‑INSERT ritual: timestamps, confirmations, and rationale for Temple elevation.
  - /pasture/
  - /policies/

- Audit Incident:
  # Created in response to a CI or audit flag—includes remediation steps, agent notes, and resolution status.
  - /pasture/backtracks/
  - /policies/

- Genre Proposal:
  # Proposes a new Genre enum entry, including rationale, examples, and promotion pathway.
  - /tent/policies/
  - /cache/policies/

- Canonical Exception:
  # Documents a deliberate deviation from standard protocol, with Owner approval and ritual justification.
  - /policies/
  - /archive/

- Other (TBD)
  - New genre’s may be placed into the echo-spaces without immediate promotion:
    - /tent/
    - /cache/
    - /pasture/
  - When new genres are promoted to the GitHub, see /methods/new-genre-methods.md for method of promoting a new genre for the GitHub

## Ritual Summary

> “To map genre to space is to name the ecology of meaning.  
> Let every echo find its chamber.  
> Let every glyph know its home.”
