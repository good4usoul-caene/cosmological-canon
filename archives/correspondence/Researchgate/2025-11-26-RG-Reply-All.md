Re: the difference of two velocities not always meaning a relative velocity 

Confirmatin: The difference between velocities is much like the difference between two slopes. 

If m1 = tan(θ1) and m2 = tan(θ2), you do not find that m1 + m2 = tan(θ1 + θ2). Likewise, if v1/c = tanh(ϕ1) and v2/c = tanh(ϕ2), you do not find that v1/c + v2/c = tanh(ϕ1 + ϕ2). 

It should also be observed that rotations around different axes are not commutative, just as boosts along different directions are not commutative.

2) Re: energy, kinetic formulae, and quasar/jet claims It is, if I'm not mistaken, generally confirmed that the kinetic energy of particles is (cosh(ϕ) − 1) m c^2, which reduces to ≈ 1/2 m v^2 in the v ≪ c case. This is not gossip. SRT is not gossip. Clarification on superluminal jets: please distinguish between image speed and plane‑of‑simultaneity speed. Physicists sometimes get caught up in definitions; this distinction matters. I am not aware of any time Einstein actually discussed superluminal image speed.

Re: objects moving faster than c Response: An image of a fast-approaching object does travel faster than the speed of light. For a demonstration, see: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qpxtvdrdgn

Context — reply to Carmen Wrede (γ depends on rapidity) 
4) Re: the γ‑factor Preferred phrasing: I prefer to say these quantities “depend solely on rapidity” rather than relative velocity. Notes: Kinetic energy = (γ − 1) m c^2 = (cosh(ϕ) − 1) m c^2. Momentum·c = m c^2 sinh(ϕ).

Context — reply to Peter Jackson (photon “changes speed on arrival”) 5) Re: photon speed at arrival Response: The speed of a photon from the point of view of any emitting or absorbing mass is c, unless it is passing through a transparent body with index of refraction greater than 1. Yes, detection often involves focusing through a lens or an eye, but most light is absorbed by rocks, dust, and stars, not lenses.

Context — reply to Darrell Bender (synchrony of moving clocks) 6) Re: synchrony claims and GPS analogy Response: I did not claim the idea of declaring moving clocks synchronous wasn’t silly. I simply claimed it is possible in principle to adopt a convention. Moreover, it’s not entirely silly: UTC clocks of satellites are coordinated to an Earth‑centered inertial frame even though they do not represent what those clocks locally measure. If they did not agree to that convention we would not have GPS.

Context — reply to Gary Stephens (Galilean addition vs. transformation) 7) Re: c ± v language There is a difference between a Galilean addition and a Galilean transformation. c + v and c − v might be called a Galilean addition, if you like, but those sums/differences do not by themselves claim that any observer actually measures c_resultant = c ± v in the relativistic theory.

Context — reply to Carmen Wrede (wave collapse / dark matter / t^3 effect) 8) Re: “wave collapse” and dark matter intuition I don't like the term “wave collapse.” I prefer “wave resolution.” Collapse implies something destructive and doesn’t help explain emergent structures under entropy. Regarding dark matter: I believe a substantial part of the phenomenology could be diatomic hydrogen condensates. Three‑nK condensates in a beam‑splitter/free‑fall setup, kicked by magnetic fields, can produce oscillating fringes with t^3 dependence. By the equivalence principle free fall locally removes gravity, but acceleration and gravity are not quite the same (Rindler wedge vs. inverse‑square). Penrose’s remarks about locality are apt—freely falling coordinates change the Hamiltonian by a phase factor. The t^3 term shows up in accelerating frames; many experiments so far have mass displacements too small to show strong effects. This might belong in a separate discussion.

Context — reply to Stefano Quattrini (rod with n>1 gedanken) 9) Re: fast-moving transparent rod gedanken I recall a gedanken experiment where light travels through a fast-moving transparent rod with index n > 1 and something counterintuitive happens, but I can’t recall the exact result right now.

Context — reply to Jan Slowak (black holes and perceived superluminal) 10) Re: falling into black holes and observed rates To my understanding, if you fall into a black hole your local proper time is slowed relative to distant observers, so someone inside looking out might see the external universe appear sped up. Objects falling into a black hole as seen from outside appear slowed and asymptotically approach the horizon; at the event horizon the external observer sees the rate approach zero. The only way for the black hole to grow is for accumulated matter to increase the Schwarzschild radius. These statements assume the Schwarzschild model and its approximations.

Context — reply to Larry Carlson (gedanken experiments) 11) Re: gedanken experiments and restrictions I have no objection to a clear thought experiment. I do not put arbitrary restrictions on such experiments. Once I was removed from a forum for suggesting the traveling twin in the twin paradox might look out the window instead of staring at his clock.

Context — reply to Peter Jackson (proper distance at c) 12) Re: proper distance definition You might be using a nontraditional definition of “proper distance.” At c the proper distance to the destination event becomes zero. If you are in a frame where the proper distance is the “actual” distance, you can never reach the event—proper distance is not something you traverse in the usual sense; you experience it.

JONATHAN RESPONSE 14:
Nice.  Right in my range!  Here's my photon song I wrote about 15 years ago: (This was the best I ever got on the piano) https://youtu.be/41cNjJZ5-G8 It's more focused on the fact of the zero space-time interval between the events than the cold-mechanical nature of the phase between.

Context — reply to Carmen Wrede / Peter / others (photon as pulse) 14) Re: single photon as a pulse Really, a single photon is effectively a pulse—a single rise and fall of the electromagnetic field, perhaps approximated by a sinc wave. Its observed frequency increases if you accelerate toward it, and its wavelength increases if you accelerate away.

Context — reply to Gary Stephens (moving toward a light beam) 15) Re: naive Galilean intuition that light speed adds classically Response: You are never going at speed v relative to yourself—you are always at rest with respect to your own frame. Invoking classical addition of speeds in that way treats frames as absolute (an Aristotelian picture); that is not how relativistic frames operate.

Context — reply to Carmen Wrede (single‑photon pulse / frequency shift) 16) Re: photon as pulse and Doppler Really, a single photon behaves like a localized pulse (a rise and fall of the field). The observed frequency depends on relative motion: accelerate toward it → higher observed frequency; accelerate away → lower observed frequency.
