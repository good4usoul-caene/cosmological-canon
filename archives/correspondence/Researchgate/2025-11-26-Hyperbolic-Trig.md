Whether or not "nobody" uses phi for CMBR, using hyperbolic trigonometric forms involving phi is superior to using algebraic forms involving v/c.  

Why prefer rapidity φ? (practical points)

Additivity: Lorentz boosts along one axis add in φ (φtotal = φ1 + φ2). 

Velocity composition becomes simple addition of rapidities instead of the messy (v1+v2)/(1+v1v2/c^2) algebra.

Linear relations: Energy and momentum take simple hyperbolic forms: 

E = m c^2 coshφ, 

p c = m c^2 sinhφ (so kinetic energy and momentum tradeoffs are transparent).

Group structure: φ parametrizes the boost subgroup of the Lorentz group; boost matrices are just coshφ / sinhφ entries, which simplifies derivations and keeps geometry explicit.

Redshift / Doppler: The exponential relation ties directly to observed redshift: 
z + 1 = e^φ (equivalently e^φ = sqrt((1+β)/(1−β))), so φ is a natural observational coordinate when you work with large z.

Avoids misleading algebra: Summing v/c is only an approximation and hides nonlinearity and non‑commutativity; 

φ keeps the hyperbolic geometry visible.

Key identities (copyable)

β ≡ v/c = tanh φ
γ = cosh φ
γβ = sinh φ
E = m c^2 cosh φ
p = m c sinh φ / c? (more standard: p = m c sinh φ)
Velocity addition: tanh(φ1 + φ2) = (tanh φ1 + tanh φ2) / (1 + tanh φ1 tanh φ2)
Doppler / redshift: z + 1 = e^φ = sqrt((1 + β)/(1 − β))
Quick proof (steps)

For a blackbody source the observed temperature scales with redshift as T_obs = T_emit / (1+z). Hence 1 + z = Tem / Tobs = 3000 / 2.73 ≈ 1098.9 ≈ 1100.

Relate redshift to rapidity φ. For a longitudinal relativistic Doppler shift 1 + z = sqrt((1 + β)/(1 − β)), and with β = tanh φ one has (1 + β)/(1 − β) = e^{2φ}, so sqrt((1 + β)/(1 − β)) = e^{φ}. Therefore 1 + z = e^{φ} and φ = ln(1 + z).

Numerical value φ = ln(3000 / 2.73) = ln(1098.901...) ≈ 7.003 → φ ≈ 7.0.

(As a check, cosh(7) ≈ 548 and tanh(7) ≈ 0.999998, consistent with a very large Lorentz factor and a source receding at effectively c in the rapidity picture.)
