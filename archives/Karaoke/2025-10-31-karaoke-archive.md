# 2025-10-31 — Halloween (The Ritz, Mac's Karaoke)

## Summary
A four-song set at The Ritz (Mac's Karaoke). Mix of intimate ballads and gritty payoff songs. Mic levels were inconsistent early in the night; audience warmed up by the final song.

## Metadata
- Date: 2025-10-31 (Halloween)
- Venue: The Ritz — Mac's Karaoke
- Host/tech: Mac
- Friends/notes: Amanda arrived in a belly-dancing costume, knew many people at the bar and made introductions that increased visibility.

## Setlist (performed, in order)
1. Angel — Sarah McLachlan  
2. White Flag — Dido  
3. Born to Run — Bruce Springsteen (comfort anchor)  
4. Creep — Radiohead (big payoff)

- Torn — not performed / uncertain (marked NOT performed in this entry)

## Sound / Audience Reaction
- Angel & White Flag: mic felt barely on / very low channel level → little audience reaction.  
- Born to Run: still nervous but could belt and be heard despite low gain (comfort 5.0).  
- Creep: mic channel up / room responded strongly — big audience payoff. You intentionally hopped an octave on some lines for a “creepy” effect and it worked.

## Comfort ratings (self)
- Born to Run: 5.0  
- Creep: 5.0 (used measured octave hops stylistically)  
- Angel: ~4.8  
- White Flag: ~4.3

## Staging / props
- Planned prop for White Flag abandoned due to no mic stand available.
- Amanda’s introductions helped convert anonymity into a small crowd of friendly listeners.

## Notes on technique / performance choices observed
- You used intentional octave hops in Creep to create texture; keep them soft/narrow-vowel for safety.  
- Letting the audience fill high lines (as happened on other nights) is a good crowd-engagement tool when a top note is marginal.  
- Mic proximity and dynamic control mattered this night — belting close worked for Born to Run when gain was low; move in for intimate lines, step back slightly for stronger belts if the channel is hot.

## Action items / follow-ups
- Ask Mac for a brief mic check before the set next time (sample text: “Hey Mac — quick favor for Friday: can we do a brief mic check when I get up? I’ve got a couple quieter songs and want to make sure the channel’s up. Thanks!”).  
- Bring a small tabletop mic stand or clip-on stand if you plan props, or rehearse the same movement without a stand.  
- Continue practicing selective high bursts and musical octave drops (narrowed vowels, slides into the note).  
- Leverage Amanda’s social connections next time — ask her to mention you to the host/regulars before you get on.
