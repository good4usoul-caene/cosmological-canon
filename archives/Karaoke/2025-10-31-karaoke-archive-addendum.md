## Leaving the bar
I left alone, and saw the police truck across the parking lot.  I didn't figure I had anything to worry about, though, since I had only had a couple of small margaritas at the beginning of the night.

## The slow-down
 - Crap.  I'm going like, 40 or 45 in a 30.  Carefully slowing down to the speed limit, making sure not to slow down so fast to wreck the tail-gater behind me.
 - Tail-gater's bright lights turn to red-blue-green cycle.  **sigh** 
 - I pull into an empty parking lot...  Indecisively.  I decide to go ahead and pull fully into the lot to give the cops plenty of room to pull in as well.
 - Two policemen.  The first looks to be later 20's, early thirties.  The second stands back.  
 - Asked to say alphabet from F to R and count backwards from 68 to 45.  Asked to get out of the car.  Asked to look at finger.  Asked to walk heel-to-toe, asked to stand on one foot.  I'm too fat for this last one.  Stood on one foot for 18 counts, but then dropped it.  
 - Breathalizer...  I breathed into the breathalizer and passed, pretty easily, I think.  If I looked drunk it was probably because I'd only slept from midnight to three the night before.  It wasn't due to the alcohol.
 - Let me off with a verbal warning.  Noted:  Don't go 40 in the 30, even when there's zero traffic.  (Perhaps, especially when you're being tail-gated by somebody with their brights on.)
 - Good news:  I can drink two margaritas without worrying about tripping the breathalizer.  
 - Thanked police officer for keeping people safe, and went home.
