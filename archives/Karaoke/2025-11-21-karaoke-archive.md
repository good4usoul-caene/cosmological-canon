## People:
**Ben**:  Ben came with me after our game night, and stayed til about 12:30;  (after Gimme One Reason).
**Amanda**: Won last week's karaoke contest!  Couldn't make it tonight; at her cousin's wedding.  
**Joey**:  Joey (I think) was a friend of Ben's.  Told me I was picking awesome songs, and killing it.  Also, if I see him first, come up and say hi.
(1):  Blonde who sang Four-Non-Blondes, "What's going On" (Was it with Joey?)
(2):  Tattooed lady in the little black dress.  Sang "Bohemian Rhapsody" with (1).  Surrounded by admirers and friends.
**Mars**: Mars did a nice job on "Take Me to Church" and whatever songs he selected.  
(3): Tall guy who was shouting to me during "thousand years".  Later told me I "killed it", which is a good thing.  
(4): Corner bar guys
(5): Female Bartender: Tall pretty lady, whose face is cherubic; hardly looks old enough to work here.  
(6): Male Bartender, who always asks me "You want a drink that tastes exactly like a margarita?"   
(7): The guy that's been there every Friday, Halloween to now.  Sang "All of Me" as last song of night.
(8): The (guy?) that maybe doesn't realize (his?) talent do, and his (girlfriend?).  
(9): The protestants.  (From 11/14, not present on 11/21).  A lovely retired couple.  She was a nurse, and he was (I forget what), but it was a career that didn't let him unwind.  He said he liked to go overboard, sometimes, with the drink, and count on grace to put him back on track.  
(10): Kyra Dean's nephew.  Cool guy, but I can't remember what he said or what he looked like, for sure.  I think he was tall.  I'm not sure if this was the same guy as (3) or a different guy.  I barely know Kyra Dean, but I do follow her on facebook, and introduced myself to her last Saturday at the Cafe.

## Definitions:
 - "took the fifth" The fifth amendment protects an individual against self incrimination.  

## Anecdotes:
 - On Halloween I asked "Do you think you would have the time to make me a Margarita?"  The bartender went to the manager and asked, but she came back and said, it's too busy tonight.  So I asked for a simple mixed drink that would have the same basic ingredients as a margarita.  On Nov. 7, I simply started by asking the bartender, "Could you make me a drink that tastes exactly like a margarita?"  And he said "I can only think of one" and he made me a margarita (on the rocks; no salt).  On Nov. 14, (9) overheard the conversation, and became very confused, wondering, "What is a drink that is NOT a margarita, but tastes exactly like a margarita?"  I corrected his priors, saying "I never said 'not' a margarita."  On 11/21, the bartender saw Ben and me, pointed and said "Drink that tastes exactly like a margarita" and "Gueniss".  Ben said, "You know your customers."  
 - During "Last song" (see 7) I worked up the nerve to say to (2), "I'm really glad you got up to sing, because then I could see you're front is as beautiful as your back."  She smiled, and said something about her back-side, but I quietly "took the fifth" insofar as the 10th commandment, and dashed off, leaving her to her other friends and admirers.  
 - I asked (3) if I'd done anything wrong, and he told me, "No.  You absolutely killed it!" 
 - On 11/14 I heard (8) singing mostly by himself on a song.  He was quiet and unpracticed, but I was so impressed by the potential, I told him how amazing it was.  On 11/21, (8) did a few songs as a duet.  Nice, but they weren't as well-practiced.  
 - Re (8) The couple seems entirely swapped from traditional gender roles.  I told him I missed his first song because I was getting a drink.  She said I'd better promise to come watch when they were up there.  I promised, but I missed half their next song.  When he asked me what music I liked, I mentioned "Aurora".  He asked me if I liked "Lana Del Ray" whom I associated with "Evanescence", but I was just wrong.  When I let him look through my youtube karaoke playlist, Mars and a couple other people said "That's a really good idea."
 - Mars told me his given name was "Marsden" and he was a Senior in (drama?) but he's planning a career in broadcasting.
 - (1) was almost as kind and effusive as Joey, and was glad to hear that I was planning to make it my tradition to come out on Friday nights to the Ritz for Karaoke.  Her own schedule included Fridays, and one or two other nights per week as well.  
 - Said to Ben, re: (5), "Does that little girl's parents know she works here?"  Commented on being 53, how amazingly young the early 20's seem.  
 - (4) spent most of night talking to (3).  They must have had a view of the stage, because after my first couple of songs, they greeted me with what felt like real acknowledgment.  At some point, I was getting a drink, and they were ROFLMAO; Laughing for like five minutes straight..  I never had any idea what had them so tickled.
 - When I was drinking my second margarita, I decided I wanted some salt.  It occurred to me to ask for a container that the bar had, but then I decided to empty my sacred container.  (My sacred container has a micro-fiber cloth I call "the whole cloth" and two pennies I call "my two cents" and a butterscotch hard candy I call "the size of my faith".  But in the moment, I wanted salt for my margarita so I pulled out all the sacred and asked the bartender to fill it with salt.  He did so, but with a warning...  "If the cops see you tasting this salt, they might want to have a talk with you."  So now all my sacred container has in it is the "salt of the earth".  
 
## Current thoughts
 - If I had a corpse for every time I was told I "killed it" last night, I would need to learn to raise the dead.  
   - (Same for when Carolyn, my near-blind, near-deaf girlfriend, says "OHH!  You scared me to death!")
 - Matthew 5:13-16  -“**You are the salt of the earth.** But if the salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.  You are the light of the world.  A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.  Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.  Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.  In the same way, **let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.**”
