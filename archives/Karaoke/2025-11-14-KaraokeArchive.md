## People:
**Julia**":  Bigger Beautiful Woman, and with an incredible voice.  I could listen to her all day.  She was very technically precise, and showed superstar talent with trills and vocal gymnastics.  A few cracks here and there, and a few places where she just stopped singing where it got out of range, or she paused to gently laugh at herself.  I think these unnecessary omissions cost her the contest. 
(1) The other pro vocalist:  Julia and her two friends were all music graduate students at WIU.  To be fair, Julia's friend had equal musical talent, I think, but he tried to improvise on a lot of the tunes.  On some, his improvisations were great, but at other times, his improvisations just made him sound like he didn't know the tune.
(2) The other music major:  Was among the 10 last week, but didn't make it into the top 4.  A competent voice.  In tune, but he didn't perform the vocal gymnastics like Julia or (1).  
**Amanda**: My friend of many years.  Experienced with a *lot* of community plays and musicals, and talent shows, and very dedicated to performance.  At one point, there was a song where she got about 90% of the way through it, and the karaoke machine went down.  During this song, she had gone around the audience of the bar with a wireless, mic, getting some reactions all over the bar.  After the machine went down, and a few minutes of troubleshooting, the karaoke-guy knelt down behind the desk, and held the cords together while Amanda performed the entire song over again, from the beginning.  To me, honestly, who was wishing I could sing another song, I kind of felt a bit impatient at having to listen to the entire song again.  But I gather the rest of the audience was quite impressed with this willingness to sing the entire song over from the beginning.  
(3) Runner Up:  This guy chose hard-rock ballads, which all were upwards of seven minutes with the inclusion of all the instrumentals.

## Anecdotes:
 - I had put in about 8 songs, and had performed only "Zombie".  At about 1 AM when the contest was wrapping up, I went and asked, gently, "Am I still in the queue?"  I wasn't.  They picked up my song list, and asked if there was any that I would prefer.  I glanced over the list, and decided the best one for me, this night, was "You're welcome!"  A boastful song, taking the role of Maui, saying "you're welcome" to people who have never thanked me, nor who even know who the hell I am.  

 
## Current thoughts
 - I try to avoid songs of the sort chosen by (3).  Instead, I find songs that do a little showing off in 4 minutes or less, and then quickly hand off to the next talent.  I don't like the instrumentals to go on for more than 20 measures or so, and if I can't really groove to the instrumental parts, even that's too long.  Also, even if a song is great, I don't like to have too many repetitions.  "The Boxer"; Lie le Lie (3:12 - 5:00) or "Hallelujah" by Leonard Cohen, though I could, I guess, to the shorter version.
