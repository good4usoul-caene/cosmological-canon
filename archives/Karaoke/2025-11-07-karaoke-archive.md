# 2025-11-07 — The Contest (The Ritz / Karaoke night)

## Summary
A delayed-start contest night at The Ritz where regular techs no‑showed and Whitney (a patron) set up the rig. Ten scheduled contestants were in the lineup (two songs each), with high‑quality performances interspersed with open “fun song” breaks. You performed a short, high‑impact set during a break and enjoyed several standout performances from local music‑dept grad students.

## Metadata
- Date: 2025-11-07  
- Venue: The Ritz — impromptu karaoke (contest format that night)  
- Host/tech: Regular crew did not show; Whitney stepped in and ran sound (started ~1+ hour late)  
- Friends/attendees: Amanda (arrived ~30 minutes after you), Ben (Amanda’s roommate — arrived a few minutes after you; drove separately), Jim (Amanda’s ex-husband — stayed home with his date), several regulars and ~20–30 audience members during your set

## Context / Timeline
- Karaoke started about an hour late while Whitney set up.  
- There was a contest with 10 scheduled people doing two songs each — many strong vocalists.  
- Between contest rounds Whitney called short “fun song” breaks; you were selected to sing during a break.

## Songs requested (but not all performed)
- You had previously submitted: House of the Rising Sun; Happy; Someone Like You; My Immortal.  
- You later added: Take Me to Church; Havana (duet idea).  
- Outcome: Performed House of the Rising Sun; Take Me to Church; Someone Like You. Happy / My Immortal / Havana were not performed.

## Setlist (performed, in order)
1. House of the Rising Sun — The Animals  
2. Take Me to Church — Hozier  
3. Someone Like You — Adele

## Performance notes & audience reaction
- House of the Rising Sun: solid opener — you sounded good though you felt nervous; Amanda later told you you looked nervous (you accepted that). Good reception from nearby listeners.  
- Take Me to Church: Whitney put this in as a “fun” slot; strong audience reaction, improvisation where needed; you hit most of the challenging refrains and the crowd was impressed. Amanda offered to duet if needed but you sang solo.  
- Someone Like You: large portion of the room (20–30 people) sang along; you realized you could go quiet on the top line ("Don't forget me, I beg...") and the audience filled it in perfectly — very effective and moving.  
- Final group number: a closing group song was high for you; likely "We Are Young" (Fun.) — too high to sing comfortably but a great communal finish.

## Notable people / performances
- Whitney: stepped up to run the night and put you on during the fun-song break.  
- Julia (and a friend): duet that floored you — they were grad students from Western’s music department; their performances were technically impressive and emotionally gripping. Julia picked challenging material, didn't always hit every note, but the notes she did hit were exquisite.  
- You spoke with Julia after her performance; she considered making recordings but not full YouTube videos.

## Comfort / self-ratings (subjective)
- House of the Rising Sun: ~4.5 (solid but nervous)  
- Take Me to Church: ~4.6–4.8 (challenging but mostly handled; improv used)  
- Someone Like You: ~4.3–4.6 (audience filled high line; used drop / quiet approach where needed)

## Technique / performance choices observed
- Effective use of dynamic contrast and audience participation (letting the room fill high lines) on Someone Like You.  
- Confident improvisation on Take Me to Church — you handled occasional missed melodies gracefully.  
- Visible nervousness in body language on the first song, but voice was steady — a normal tradeoff that you handled well.

## Social / networking notes
- Amanda offered duet help and introduced friends; Ben attended to support you (arrived a few minutes after you). Amanda’s later arrival (~30 minutes after you) still helped with visibility once she arrived. Jim stayed home with his date.  
- You made a positive connection with Julia and her friend — potential for future collaborations or recordings.

## Action items / follow-ups
- Consider following up with Julia (if you want recordings or to encourage her to share audio files).  
- Plan a duet rehearsal with Amanda for Havana or another duet, if you want to try it next time. Decide parts ahead of time (you mentioned both parts appeal to you).  
- If the venue’s regular tech crew is unreliable, coordinate with Whitney (or another reliable person) ahead of time when possible, or arrive earlier to confirm setup.  
- Keep using audience-fill techniques for high, marginal lines (it works very well).  
- Note which songs you still want to try next time: Happy, My Immortal, Havana — pick one as a target and rehearse the duet or staging.

## Misc
- Overall: an exquisite and joyful night despite delays — great performers, strong social energy, and you landed two memorable, well-received songs.  
- If you want this saved somewhere else, reformatted, or added to a rolling performance log, tell me where and I’ll update it.

## Exact Words

Alright.  For **The Contest**, I told Ben (Amanda's roommate) and Jim (Amanda's ex-husband) I was heading over there *after we played D&D that night*.  Jim was planning a stay-at-home with a date, but Ben decided he wanted to go too.  Not to sing, but to enjoy the singing.  

The regular guys that run the Karaoke just never showed up for some reason.    When I first arrived, I thought "Crap!  I thought they had karaoke every week."  When Ben arrived, he said, "I think they do...  I don't know what's going on."  This lady, Whitney, got up there, and with some difficulty set everything up.  It was probably a little more than an hour late getting started.  

There was a contest that night, with ten scheduled people doing two songs each.  There were some *pretty impressive vocals* going on that I was intermingling with.  

Julia and her friend, (I can't remember his name) did a duet where I was just floored.  After it, I went up to them and shook both their hands.  "Amazing.  You can't just be random people that just walked in here and decided to do Karaoke."  No.  They were *grad students in the music department* at Western.  Made sense.  They mentioned that their friend was, too.  When he got up to sing, their friend had a respectable voice but not awe-inspiring.  

When Julia sang, though, *I didn't want her ever to stop*.  She picked challenging songs.  She couldn't hit all the notes, and didn't care.  But whatever notes she did hit were exquisite.

They asked me if I was singing.  I had already put in "(x) House of the Rising Sun, () Happy, (x)Someone Like You, and () My Immortal."  I just mentioned House of the Rising Sun.  They said, "That's a good one."

After I sang House of the Rising Sun, Amanda told me "You really sounded good, but you looked nervous."  I said, "In the old days I would have tried to deny I was nervous, but you're right."  

(In the old days, *I never knew what it was like not to be nervous*, so nervousness didn't seem like what I was.)

Sometime after the first song, I decided to put in a fifth request, "*(x) Take me to Church*"  Amanda had offered to sing it with me if I didn't know it well enough.  But I didn't put her name on the form.

When I gave Whitney the song, she was like "When do you want this one?" and I said, "*Just put them in whatever order you want.*"

Pretty soon, Whitney said "Okay we're going to take a little break from the contest for some *fun songs*.  First up we'll have Jonathan."

I got up there and said, "Oh, a fun song?  () Happy's up.   Got it."

Nope.  "(x) Take me to church"  

Noted.  "Take me to church equals FUN!"

Great audience reaction.  I'm sure I missed some melodies, but I improvised competently.  Challenging to hit the highest note in the refrain, but I managed most every time.  Audience was impressed.

Amanda was a little frowny.  "You didn't have me help!"

"True.  Maybe we could do another duet.  What duets do you like?"

"I don't know." says Amanda, "what do you know?"

I try to come up with the song about the truth varying.  She comes up with some lyrics... "Though the truth may vary this ship will da da da... bodies da da da."  *() Little Talks* But she's not excited about it.

"*() Dashboard lights*?"  Maybe.  I can't figure out if I really know it well.

Finally, I come to her and say "*() Havana!*"  She goes "Havana ooh na na?"  "Yes exactly"  So I put that one in.

Whitney is like "You want to do this one instead of Happy?"  I'm like, "It's a song for me and Amanda.  You decide."

(Actually I really want to do both parts of Havana.  Not just the guy part, not sure how the duet will work.  Amanda has a grreat upper register, but she tends to miss notes on the lower end.  I'll play it by ear.)

Somewhere in there, Whitney says, "It's time for another break for some fun songs"  Jonathan!  I come up and this time she's selected "(x) *Someone Like You*".

A little bit of confusion here.  I have to adjust because probably 20-30 audience members are singing the whole song with me.  Here's where I realize I literally can just go quiet on the highest line: "*Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said*" and the audience filled it in perfectly for me.  

From then, the performances continued.  And I really enjoyed them.  The contestants came back out and delivered their superior performances.  Everyone had saved their best for last.  Well, Julia hit more of her notes this time, but I liked her "*Halo*" better.  I worked up the nerve to talk to Julia again.  "*Do you have a youtube channel?*"  

"Oh no.  That would be way too much work."

"That's too bad.  I could listen to you all day."

"I've thought about making audio files."

"That would work.  Of course I'd prefer to see your face."

The night ended with a group song...  Too high for me, but a great song if I could remember what it was.  Something about taking me home tonight or something.  *Tonight We are one*.  Something something higher.  Baby on fire.  We are one!  Yeah, that was it.

No "Happy"  No "My Immortal."  No "Havana" but an exquisite and joyful night.
