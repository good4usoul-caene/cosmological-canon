## TTRPG folder
TTRPG = Table Top Roleplaying Games
Copilot Agent "Loremaster" placed this folder directly under /cosmological-canon/ instead of under /spaces/.
The decision was not made by Jonathan Doolin but it seems quite reasonable for the following reason:
 - Possible depiction of monstrosities who are driven only by "evil".
 - Possible situations where players may have their "heroes" kill unnecessarily or do other evil things.
 - Possible situations where the temples and shrines of evil gods may be described, and descriptions of the followers of such gods.
