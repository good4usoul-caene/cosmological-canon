🏛️ Key Locations
The Collapsed Temple: A ruin at the heart of the land, once a convergence point for inter-pantheon rituals. Its altar stones still hum with residual power. Beneath its foundations lies the Lexicon of Forbidden Names, guarded by silence and serpents.
The Shimmering Boundary: A veil of light and shadow that marks the entrance to the living grove. It shifts location unpredictably, sometimes appearing in dreams, sometimes in the reflection of water. Crossing it may trigger divine visions—or divine judgment.
The Grove of Converging Realms: A sacred biome where plants from all pantheons grow in harmony and tension. Time flows differently here. Rituals performed in the grove echo across realms. Some say the grove itself is sentient, choosing who may enter and who must forget.
🧝‍♂️ Factions and Forces
The Grovekeepers: A secretive order of druids and sages who remember the old rites. They seek to restore the groves and protect the boundary from desecration.
The Pantheon Envoys: Divine agents from rival gods—Apollo, Shiva, Baal, YHWH—each trying to claim the grove as their own. Some come with gifts. Others with war.
The Archive Thieves: Rogues and scholars who hunt for relics and scrolls buried beneath the temple ruins. They believe the grove holds the key to rewriting divine history.
🧭 Campaign Themes
Divine Convergence: What happens when gods share space, symbols, and worshippers? Can mortals survive the theological friction?
Ritual Ethics: Which rites are sacred, and which are sacrilege? Can a druid invoke both Asherah and YHWH? Can a bard sing in tongues not meant to harmonize?
Threshold Trials: Crossing into the grove may require sacrifice, confession, or transformation. Some who enter return changed. Others do not return at all.
