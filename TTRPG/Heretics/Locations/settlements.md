What it borders
- Thornehold sits at the approach to the western mountain passes and the timbered highlands. It functions as a gateway between the capital’s road network and the outlying uplands and mines that lie beyond the passes.

## GM Guidance for Public Use
- Use this document as the player‑visible description of towns and public figures. It intentionally omits sensitive routes, hidden doors, and covert contacts.
- If you wish to incorporate secrets, covert networks, or campaign hooks for private discovery, place those details in a separate GM file (staged in /cache/ or /tent/) marked for private use.
- For Session‑0: assign player pregens to the suggested origins above to give clear hometown ties and visible job-locations they can use in roleplay.

---

## Short session‑starter hooks (public)
- Virelia Harvest Fair: a public festival that draws civic attention and clergy preachers.
- Thornehold Market Night: caravans and performers converge; a good place to recruit contacts or present a performance.
- Elen’s Watch Promenade Day: an occasion for scholars and herbalists to exchange knowledge in public view.
- Caelumbré Public Address: a city proclamation day where the Clerisy makes formal announcements.

## Ritual Summary (public)
“Place your feet where the town greets the road. Let the basilica be visible, the shrine be heard, and the promenade be walked. Secrets belong to the steward’s ledger—this file holds only what any traveler might read on a brass plaque.”
