# Heretics — Campaign Space

## Overview

Welcome to the **Heretics** campaign space—a TTRPG (tabletop role-playing game) arc set in the cosmology of Pascal's Wager and the Destarie setting.

This directory contains:
- **Character files**: Pregen PCs and NPCs for the campaign
- **Encounter plans**: Session seeds and adventure hooks
- **Chronicles**: Campaign notes, session logs, and world-building artifacts

## Setting Summary

**Pascal's God and the Singular Gaze**  
In the world of Destarie, Pascal's God claims to be the only true deity. The faithful call this the Singular Gaze—the watchful eye of the one divine being who promises eternal paradise to believers and damnation to heretics. The Clerisy of the Gaze enforces this doctrine with scripture, inquisition, and steel.

**The Heretics**  
But not everyone believes. Some remember—or have discovered—that other gods once existed. These forgotten pantheons were erased, their names struck from records, their temples buried. Those who seek to restore this lost knowledge are branded heretics.

The PCs are such heretics: defiers of the Singular Gaze, seekers of forbidden truths, wielders of relics tied to vanished gods.

## Campaign Themes
- **Faith vs. Knowledge**: Is belief a virtue or a prison?
- **Forbidden Memory**: What happens when the past is erased?
- **Divine Politics**: If gods exist, do they deserve worship?
- **Choice Under Pressure**: Break your oath or uphold a lie?

## How to Use These Files

### For Players
- Review the **Characters/** folder to choose a pregen PC or understand your party members.
- **Corra-Voss-knowledge.md** contains hooks and arcs for the core PCs—read it to understand your character's motivations.
- Pregen sheets (Elara, Lys) are ready-to-play with stats, equipment, and personality notes.

### For GMs
- Start with **Chronicles/encounters/market-heist.md** for the opening session.
- NPC files (Aldra Vey, Aldric Vale) include stat blocks and roleplay guidance.
- Use the **PC Hooks** file to tie individual character arcs into session plots.

### For World-Builders
- All files follow the cosmological-canon metadata format (see file headers).
- Feel free to add new characters, encounters, or lore artifacts as the campaign progresses.
- Stage new files in this directory and update this README to reflect additions.

## Campaign Status

**Current Phase**: Setup / Session Zero  
**Next Session**: Market Heist encounter (see Chronicles/encounters/market-heist.md)

## Lore Connections

This campaign ties into the broader **cosmological-canon** repository:
- **Pascal's God**: Central figure in the Destarie theology (see /library/theology/)
- **Grove of Converging Realms**: Sacred space tied to Lys Whisper (see world-building notes)
- **Forbidden Divine Names**: Key plot device connected to Aldra Vey's research

For deeper lore, consult the main repository's `/library/` and `/spaces/` directories.

## Contribution Guidelines

If you're adding to this campaign space:
1. Use the metadata header format (see existing files as templates).
2. Place character files in `/Characters/`, encounters in `/Chronicles/encounters/`.
3. Keep tone consistent: morally complex, theologically rich, player-agency-focused.
4. Update this README when adding new sections or major files.
