My suggestions.
(1) First we need to establish descriptions for the two kings representing Drupada and Brahmin Drona and weave them into our settings.  
(3) Establish a history that the entire kingdom once belonged to Drupada.  Drona had Drupada kidnapped, and then restored half the kingdom to him.


   Jonathan:  So if I want to put a reincarnation of Draupadi in my roleplaying game, (1) her father should be an aristocrat whose lands were taken by a cleric, and then essentially leased back to him (before she was born) (2) she should have no idea who her mother is, or possibly even have tiefling traits. (3) She should have a brother who may have killed several of the people working for the cleric, also with possible tiefling traits. (4) She might be called by her father to wed for political reasons.

   Revision:  
    (0) Elara Keene (NPC) will be the Draupadi figure, though she might not take that name
    (1.1) King Drupada seeks both a daugher and son for an adoption ceremony.  
    (1.2) There are two kings in the land.  The Brahmin (priest/scholar caste), Drona, and the Kshatriya (Warrior/Ruler caste), Drupada.  
    (1.3) As children Drupada and Drona were friends, and Drupada said he would share the kingdom with Drona.
    (1.4) Drona, born a Brahmin, was trained as a warrior, became a martial teacher.  He accepted wealth,fought wars, sought revenge.  
    (1.5) When Drona came to Drupada and made a serious petition to ask for what was promised in 1.3, Drupada no longer felt any of the friendship he had once felt, and said "Friendship exists only between equals. How can there be friendship between a king and a poor Brahmin like you?"
    (1.6) Drona resolved to take Drupada's lands by force.  He brought in the Kauravas, (100 sons of King Dhiritarashtra and Queen Gandhari), and their daughter Dunshala.  And the sons of King Pandu (Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, sons of his wife Kunti, and Nakula and Sahadeva, twin sons of his concubine)  Ultimately, Drona decided only Arjuna was needed to handle the task.
    (1.7) Arjuna was sent to kidnap Drupada.  The operation was successful.  With the threat of killing Drupada in captivity, the Kaurava's quickly gained access to Drupada's inner courts, and had their knives at the throats of his trusted advisors.  In a coup, all of the lands of Drupada became Drona's.  
    (1.8) As the coup was established, Drona regularly visited Drupada in his cell, talking about their childhood, and how "it wouldn't have had to be this way if you'd kept your promise to me...  You called me a beggar.  Now I am your master."
    (1.9) After months, and Drona had executed any advisors that he could not make loyal, and fully had established his iron grip on the throne, he said to Drupada, "I will not keep you in chains.  I will divide the kingdom as you promised you would do for me.  I will keep the northern half, and I will give you back the southern half.  Now we are equals.  Let us be friends."
    (2.1) Having been freed, but many of his best advisors executed, Drupada outwardly accepts the gesture.
    (2.2) He performs a fire sacrifice to praying to produce (adopt) a son (Dhrishtadyumna) who will kill Drona.  And a daughter who would bring the destruction of all the Kauravas.  

(2) I think it might be reasonable to establish Callisto as a court astrologer that is called upon by both of them.  Callisto for whatever reason mostly takes Drupada's side.  Though he plays them both against the other.  (Callisto will mostly be on Drupada's side, because Drona's coup involved killing of good and wise people.)
(4) Establish how the idea of an adoption ceremony came to Drupada.  It might be through astrology or tarot.  (See 2.2, above, but the full story is incomplete)  Also see /TTRPG/Heretics/Planning/Chapter02/adoption-ritual.md for quick ideas on how the scene will play out.
(5) Our characters will become involved when Callisto asks Lys to find candidates for the adoption.  Elara Keene is a clear candidate as Draupadi.  For Dhrishtadyumna, we might introduce another NPC.  Aldric and Corra might be interviewed as well.
   Sample interviews (NPCs) in samved-interview.md and spark-interview.md 
(6) We need to establish how the adoption ceremony is played.  How are the illusions put in place that the adopted children are born of fire?  Who are the target audience, and how are they assembled?  Whether this will a stage for a combat scene?  
(7) Any scene that could potentially result in "rolling initiative" might be expanded at the game table into a combat scene, or at least a turn-taking scene.  

# Kingdom Origins & The Fire Adoption Ceremony

## 1. The Two Kings: Drupada & Drona

**King Drupada:**  
Once absolute ruler, Drupada now wears the wounds of betrayal and restoration. His rule is ceremonial, his pride undiminished but haunted by loss.  
*Appearance*: Silvered hair braided with snake emblems; robes of sunset gold. His eyes burn with a father's ambition and a courtier's dignity.

**Brahmin Drona:**  
Once temple priest, risen by martial cunning and politics. Drona orchestrated Drupada’s kidnapping, splitting the kingdom—now he rules half, as cleric and noble.  
*Appearance*: Saffron tunic over steel, fingers ink-stained from prophecy scrolls. He is severe, but masks emotion behind ritual.  
*Court Rivalry*: Each king now claims legitimacy; their agents and legacies overlap in every courtly intrigue.

## 2. Callisto: Court Astrologer & Schemer

**Background**:  
Callisto, royal court astrologer, is summoned by both Drupada and Drona to read signs, answer auguries, and plan omens.  
**Allegiance**:  
While formally neutral, Callisto subtly favors Drupada—offering him more actionable prophecies. Frequently plays the kings against each other with ambiguous counsel, making himself indispensable.

## 3. The Kingdom's Fractured History

- The whole kingdom once belonged to Drupada.
- During a period of weakness (illness, betrayal?), Drona kidnapped Drupada and won dominion as priest-king.
- After intrigue and reconciliation (or ransom), Drona restored half the kingdom.
- The lands now remain officially divided, but the restoration is ceremonial—old wounds fester beneath civil propriety.

## 4. How the Adoption Ceremony Was Conceived

- Drupada, desperate to reestablish his lineage, turns to Callisto for advice.
- Callisto, using astrology and forbidden tarot readings, proposes a symbolic adoption—echoing ancient myth, fulfilling prophecy.
- The signs (constellation scrolls, particular Tarot cards) align, marking Elara Keene and a yet-unseen candidate (Dhrishtadyumna analog) as destined adoptees.
- Rumor spreads: the court prepares for a fire-lit adoption, seeking to evoke mythic favor from gods, spirits, and the crowd.

## 5. Role of PCs & Candidate Selection

- Callisto employs PC Lys Whisper (messenger, clairvoyant) to locate ideal candidates for the adoption:  
  - Elara Keene is the clear Draupadi analog—sensual bard, marked by prophecy.  
  - Dhrishtadyumna’s role may be filled by a new NPC (perhaps secretive, tiefling-marked, or an outsider hero).
  - Aldric and Corra may be interviewed or tested, each reflecting aspects of the prophecy.  
- Candidates are evaluated by omens, performance, battle, promise, or secret test.

## 6. Staging the Illusion: Born of Fire

**Performance Plan**  
- A massive bonfire is built in the palace courtyard or temple square.
- Candidates are kept hidden, masked in ash or cloaked in shadow.
- **Illusionists, bards, and Callisto himself stage a ritual:** at the ceremony’s height, candidates emerge as if from the flame—horns aglow, skin shimmering, garbed in elemental grandeur.
- *Prophecy is intoned*: the crowd, spellbound, believes in miraculous birth/adoption.
- Special effects: magical pyrotechnics, mirrors, bardic illusions, tactical use of shadow and voice.

**Target Audience**  
- Nobles, priests, merchant guilds, and common folk all attend.
- Drona may send spies or saboteurs, hoping to disrupt or expose the ritual.
- The scene may escalate—jealous rivals, political adversaries, or mythic interference.

## 7. Combat & Turn-Taking Potential

- Any scene—especially public, ritualized, or sabotaged—can turn to *initiative*:  
  - If Drona’s agents disrupt the ritual (poison, attack, reveal), battle may erupt.
  - If gods, spirits, or omens manifest unpredictably, players may act in rounds (negotiation, defense, ritual magic).
- *GM Guidance*: Prepare "what happens if the ritual is interrupted" contingencies—who fights, who flees, what is revealed.

# Scene Expansion Notes

- Ritual may end in political triumph, divine intervention, or tragic chaos—how the ritual unfolds sets the mythic tone for the campaign’s next arc.
- Use omens, augury, and prophecy actively—every choice, action, and interruption wields mythic consequence.

---

**GM Usage**:  
This framework supports both table improvisation (scene seeds, NPC lines, ritual mechanics) and pre-game session prep (background, hooks, world geography). Use it to introduce Drupada, Drona, Callisto, and the adoption candidates, and set up the first great test or confrontation of your new arc.

# Draupadi Reborn: A Roleplaying Framework

## Origin Glyphs

**Father: The Dispossessed Aristocrat**  
- Drupadi (King of half the realm)
- Once a noble landholder, now bound by a divine lease.  (changed)
- The cleric who took his lands claims spiritual authority—perhaps a god of justice or order.  (through a coup)
- The father’s bitterness simmers beneath ritual civility. He performs a sacrificial rite to reclaim power… and she is born. (adopted, but observers will see a grown woman born from fire)

**Mother: Unknown or Elemental**  
- No known mother. She may have emerged from flame, shadow, or celestial pact.  (adopted, but observers will see a grown woman born from fire)
- Tiefling traits (horns, eyes, resistance to fire) mark her as not of this world.  (TBD)
- Her birth is whispered as a divine anomaly—some say she was summoned, not born.  (Rumors will be spread both by people who know the truth, and by those who don't.)

**Brother: The Blooded Flame**  
- Her twin or elder brother, also tiefling-marked.  (may be samved, spark, or one of the PCs)
- Trained in secret arts, he has already slain several of the cleric’s agents.  (Agents are Kaurava; 100 sons of King Dhiritarashtra and Queen Gandhari.)
- His existence is half-known, half-feared. He may be her protector—or her shadow.  (Ultimately, he is fated to kill Drona)

## Character Hooks

**The Political Marriage**  
- Her father calls her to wed a noble heir from a rival house to reclaim status.  (After Ch02)
- The suitor may be a paladin, a warlock, or even a disguised agent of the cleric.  
- She suspects the marriage is a trap—but the ritual must proceed.

**The Swayamvara Twist**  
- She declares her own challenge: a trial of fire, truth, or prophecy.  (After Ch02)
- Only one who passes may claim her hand.  
- The challenge may reveal secrets about her origin, her brother, or the cleric’s true nature.

**The Vow of Vengeance**  
- She swears never to bind her hair until the cleric’s dominion is broken.  (After Ch02)
- Her hair becomes a symbol—unbound, wild, and sacred.

## 🕊️ Mythic Themes to Weave In

- Born of ritual, not affection  
- Used as a pawn, but speaks as a queen  
- Carries fire in her blood, but grace in her speech  
- Her fall may be tragic, but her voice will echo

---

**Usage for GM/Players:**  
Use this framework to introduce Elara Keene (or another NPC) as Draupadi reborn. Tie scenes, omens, and character choices to these mythic origins and hooks; let challenges, betrayals, and acts of grace play out in fire-lit, prophecy-driven encounters. Her mythic resonance should change the course of marriages, alliances, trials, and vengeance throughout the campaign.
