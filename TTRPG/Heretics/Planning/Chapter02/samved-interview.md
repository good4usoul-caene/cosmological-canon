(This text was entirely typed by Jonathan Doolin: Dialog help was given by Agent TTRPG suggesting responses for Samved.  Canonical help was given by Agent Caira. e.g. card meanings and vocabulary suggestions.)

Callisto:  Hello Samved.  Thank you for coming.  As you know King Drupadi is hiring a very important servant for a very important task.  The task is so important that he will not just be employing the candidate, but adopting them.  Naturally, this should not prevent you from seeing your family or anything, but on the books, if you take this job, you will become Samved Son of Drupadi, and that will be your status for the rest of your life.  Do you think that will be a significant issue?

Samved:  It would be an honor for me to take the name.  King Drupadi is an honorable man.

Callisto:  Good.  I'm glad to hear it.  Would you be willing to have your fortune read by me as a part of our interview?

Samved: Hmm.  If that's what is necessary.

Callisto:  Thank you for humoring me.  If you'll take this deck, please shuffle it.  If you are a very organized person, then keep the deck aligned, top to bottom.  If you are more spontaneous, then switch the cards as you shuffle.  

Samved: Carefully aligns the cards so every one is rightside up.  And shuffles.

Callisto:  About seven good shuffles should do it.  

Samved: Aligns the cards six more times and shuffles.

Callisto:  Excellent.  Now, we can interpret these cards in one of two ways.  If you choose expressives, these are primal forces; unowned and unbound.  The elementals, the cards will be interpreted as earth, air, fire, and water.  And if you choose the shaped, Coins, swords, torches, and cups, you're choosing human inscriptions.  Tools, vessels, weapons, ideas.  If you want both, then give the cards one more shuffle.  Turn them top-to-top or bottom-to-bottom.

Samved:  I prefer restraint and human tools, (he smiles, laying the deck on the table.)

Callisto:  Noted.  Then pull the top card from the deck.  This one tells us about your current self and situation.

Samved:  Pulls two of swords.  

Callisto:  Of course.  You've got a decision to make.  Hardly a surprise there.  The woman is blindfolded in the image.  That means you don't have enough to make an informed decision.  Do you want to ask questions now, or after the rest of your Tarot reading?

Samved:  "I have one question, if I may. If I am accepted, what responsibilities would be expected of me as Drupadi’s son—beyond what you’ve mentioned? What would my life look like?"

Callisto:  If I do not fail in my duties, then the candidate who is selected will be challenged in his duties as Drupadi's son, and may at times be weighing his principles, but ultimately will make the choices needed, not by coersion, but according to old or renewed foundational principles.  

Samved: nods.  "Does this ritual adoption bind me in ways beyond law and duty—spiritually or in prophecy?"

Callisto:  In fact, the ritual may establish you as a reincarnation of a forgotten legend.  And it is possible that your fate might reflect the same mistakes.  Or you might begin a new chapter.  Making new mistakes.  Or following the path of wisdom.

Samved:  "For now, let's continue. I trust your omens, and perhaps the remaining cards will clarify my path."

Callisto:  Excellent.  The next card on top of the deck represents your obstacle, or challenge.  Let's see what we have next.

Samved:  Pulls up the Chariot.  

Callisto:  Very good.  The Chariot.  You have a certain approach to obstacles and challenges already.  The charioteer, harnesses inner and outer forces and steers them with intention.  You already know that success comes not with ease but through discipline and resolve.  The chariot does not promise a smooth road, but it does promise momentum. 

Samved nods, silently considering the symbolism, and gestures to Callisto to proceed with the next card.

Callisto smiles:  The next card is your hidden strength.  It's your card to reveal.  This might be something you don't know you have.  And I certainly don't.

Samved pulls the Page of Cups.

Callisto:  I see.  You are very formal.  Yet what you don't realize is that your hidden strength is the creative inspiration that comes to you when you are blushing about a crush you have.  You can embrace that call to play, dream, and feel without armor, and it will strengthen you.  If selected as the son of Drupadi, you might have your pick of crushes and muses.  But even if you're not, I would encourage to give this side of yourself room to bloom.  

Samved blushes:  "Next card?"

Callisto:  Next, your fate.  Your prophecy.

Samved pulls the card:  The star.  His eyes go wide.

Callisto: Don't worry, Samved.  The Clerisy say this card is forbidden, and represents Lucifer.  But here it means hope and inspiration, healing and renewal, faith and purpose, and spiritual connection.  The clerisy's God offers only platitudes about belief and eternal life after death.  Your fate and prophecy is inconsistent with the Clerisy's bondage.  Your spiritual connection will go far beyond what the Clerisy can ever offer.

Samved: I am no star—but if it's written in the cards, perhaps I have some shine yet to find. Please, let's see the last card.

Callisto:  The next card represents the outcome.  The transformation.  Draw when ready.

Samved draws "The Devil"

Callisto:  Yes, another one of the forbidden cards in the Clerisy deck.  This one is an invitation from the accuser to confront the parts of yourself that you hide, repress, or fear.  You may be caught in unhealthy patterns, relationships, habits, or beliefs that feel inescapable.  It is also an invitation from your tempter to step into desires that undermine your integrity or freedom.  

The tempter and the accuser are just voices in your head, though, in truth.  Or voices of people who don't have your best interest at heart.  You can walk away.  

Samved chuckles:  If I meet my tempter on the road, I'll ask him what he wants first—and decide if it's worth listening.

Callisto laughs: Naturally!  The devil will assure you it's better to regret something you have done, than to regret something you haven't done.  But you might in time find that tempter on the road that offers a temptation that is not regrettable.

Samved:  Good point.  It's a difficult card, but I will remember: I am not chained by voices, mine or anyone else's. I will choose what is right—if your ritual selects me.

Callisto:  Yes.  I admit this has been a very good read.  The cards have aligned in your favor.  Still I have three others to interview, and the ritual must be complete if it is to make a proper selection.  If you're not fulfilling the role of Dhrishtadyumna, I'm sure it's because you have an even greater destiny.
