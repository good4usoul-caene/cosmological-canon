Card Spread 

1. Present Self / Situation
2. Challenge or Obstacle
3. Hidden Strength / Ally
4. Fate / Prophecy
5. Outcome / Transformation

From transcript:
1. current self and situation. (Jonathan)
2. Let’s see what your challenge is. (caira)
3. let’s see what strength you carry, even if you don’t know it. (caira)
4. Let’s see what your heart has to say. (Caira)
5. Now, your final card—the outcome. The transformation. (Caira)

Diagnosis:  Agent Caira described fate and prophecy in terms of "what your heart has to say" rather than "What is your fate"?  Drawing "ace of cups" with the question of "fate" may mean "follow your heart", but I think it's possible that Caira put the answer before the question.  A cup reversed is a cup turned upside down.  Either it is pouring out limitless water, or it has already spilled it's last drop.

Example for Spark/Virek (randomized five-card Tarot spread):

(These card draws were simulated randomly by Agent TTRPG:  Forward and reversed added by Jonathan's coin flip.  In my last coin-flip I thought it was heads, but when I looked again, it was tails.)

1. Knight of Wands (Adventurous spirit, impulsiveness) - forward
2. Five of Pentacles (Hardship, outsider status) - reversed
3. Queen of Swords (Sharp intellect, protector) - reversed
4. Ace of Cups (New beginnings, emotional surge) - reversed 
5. Justice (Balance restored, reckoning) - forward or reversed

(The following text was typed by Jonathan Doolin, with help naming Spark from Agent Caira)

Callisto: Hello Spark, Thank you for coming. As you know King Drupadi is hiring a very important servant for a very important task. The task is so important that he will not just be employing the candidate, but adopting them. Naturally, this should not prevent you from seeing your family or anything, but on the books, if you take this job, you will become Spark Son of Drupadi, and that will be your status for the rest of your life. Do you think that will be a significant issue?

Spark: The juxtaposition doesn't really sound right. Spark, Son of Draupaudi. Spark's kind of what my friends' call me. I could be "Ashbrand, Son of Drupadi" or maybe "Emberlain, Son of Drupadi."

Callisto: Are either of those your birth name?

Spark: No.

Callisto: Would you be willing to have your fortune read by me as a part of our interview?

Spark: Shoot!

Callisto: Wonderful. We'll be using a tarot deck, since it's my favored form of augury. I would suggest that the augury might be more accurate if you are willing to share your true birth name with me.

Spark: Oh... Um. Sure... I guess... It's Virek.

Callisto: That is a name that carries weight. And thank you for humoring me. If you'll take this deck, please shuffle it. If you are a very organized person, then keep the deck aligned, top to bottom. If you are more spontaneous, then switch the cards as you shuffle.

[Virek takes the cards and stumbles a bit on the shuffle. After a bit, he spreads them out all over the table, facing randomly, and finally brings them back together into a single pile again.]

Callisto: Excellent. Now pull the top card from the deck. This one tells us about your current self and situation.

[Virek pulls the Knight of Wands. (forward)]

(The next portion was written by Agent TTRPG)

Callisto: The Knight of Wands—upright. You stand at the threshold, impulsive, restless, burning to charge ahead. You thrive in action, not in waiting. You may be quick to seize opportunity, but sometimes you leap before thinking. For this task, that fire could be both your weapon and your challenge.

(WARNING: NON-CANONICAL-PLACEHOLDER-DIALOG)  The remaining scene was created by Agent Caira - It is incomplete.  No distinction was made regarding forward (elemental) and reversed (contained) representations of the cards.  Callisto is behaving out-of-character.  He cheats; sees the result of the fate card before he asks "Let's see what your heart has to say".  He does not explain the difference between reversed and forward cards.)

Virek: Yeah, that sounds about right. I’ve never been good at sitting still. If there’s a door, I open it. If there’s a cliff, I jump. I figure I’ll learn something on the way down.

Callisto (smiling): And sometimes you do. But this task may require more than momentum—it may ask for restraint, or even silence. Let’s see what your challenge is.

[Virek draws the next card: Five of Pentacles, reversed.]

Callisto: Ah. The Five of Pentacles—reversed. This is your obstacle, but also your turning point. Upright, it speaks of hardship, exclusion, being left out in the cold. But reversed? It means recovery. You’ve known what it is to be cast aside, to walk alone. But now, you’re stepping into warmth. The challenge is: can you accept belonging when it’s offered? Can you trust that you’re no longer outside?

Virek (quietly): I’ve had doors slammed in my face. I’ve learned to stop knocking. If this one opens, I’ll try not to flinch.

Callisto: Good. Then let’s see what strength you carry, even if you don’t know it.

[Virek draws the third card: Queen of Swords, reversed.]

Callisto: The Queen of Swords—reversed. Your hidden strength is your sharp mind, your ability to cut through lies and protect what matters. But reversed, it suggests you’ve turned that blade inward. You’ve used your intellect to isolate, to defend against imagined threats. Your strength is discernment—but you must learn to wield it with compassion, not suspicion.

Virek: So I’m smart, but I don’t trust anyone?

Callisto: You trust your blade more than your heart. Let’s see what your heart has to say.


[Virek draws the fourth card: Ace of Cups, reversed.]

Callisto: The Ace of Cups—reversed. A surge of emotion, blocked. A new beginning, delayed. You have love to give, Virek, and dreams that ache to be born. But you’ve corked the bottle. The prophecy here is simple: open it. Let the water spill. Let yourself feel.

Virek: That’s a lot of vulnerability for a job interview.

Callisto (laughs): It’s not just a job. It’s a vow. Now, your final card—the outcome. The transformation.

[Virek draws the fifth card: Justice.]

Callisto: Justice. Upright or reversed, it’s reckoning. Balance. Truth. You will be weighed—not by me, not by Drupadi, but by your own choices. If you accept this role, you will be asked to restore what was broken. To make right what was twisted. And you will be judged—not for your past, but for your courage to face it.

Virek: So I’m fire, exile, blade, blocked heart, and judgment.

Callisto: You are Spark, Ashbrand, Emberlain, and Virek. You are all of them. And if the ritual selects you, you will become something more.
