Original phrasing (verbatim)
"Callisto arranges a meeting with Lys, through a friend, and when Lys arrives he tells you he's interested in obtaining some scrolls of the constellations.  Lys says he might be able to find a contact in his network that might be able to get that for him.  But Callisto specifies, I hear rumors that there may actually be a 13th sign of the zodiac.  So when you do make your contacts see if you can find anyone that can create all thirteen.  Thirteen, alright.  It's all the same to me.  Of course, there will be a fee, as expected.  This sounds like above and beyond, I'll be charging a full 100 gp.  Hmm.  Callisto says.  I think I can afford that.  Of course, I'll need to match the buying cost as well.  I'm sure that whoever has the 13 Zodaiacs should be interested in the 8 prime arcana.  Just let them know that I can get them to them."

Cleaned read-aloud (GM use)
Callisto sits near the window with a folded ledger between his palms. "I've been turning over old charts," he says after a slow sip, "and I hear rumors—if there's a thirteenth sign, it may be worth locating a complete set. If you can find or commission all thirteen zodiac scrolls, I will pay a finder’s fee of one hundred gold pieces, and I will match whatever purchase price you must pay to secure them. Tell anyone you talk to that I can move the Eight Prime Arcana in trade; that will make a sale simpler. Be discreet. If one of those scrolls bears the thirteenth sign, it is a delicate thing."

Assignment objectives (what Lys was asked to do)
- Locate or commission a complete set of the 13 Zodiacal scrolls (12 traditional + the rumored 13th).
- Primary options for acquisition:
  - Find a seller who already has a complete set.
  - Commission an archivist/scribe/archivist (Aldra-style) to create the full set (8-hour ritual for one scroll).
- Financial terms: Callisto will pay a 100 gp finder’s fee plus cover/match the purchase cost Lys incurs to obtain the scrolls.
- Trade leverage: Mention that Callisto can move/offer the Eight Prime Arcana as part of a trade with the scroll-holder.

Suggested seller-facing script (what Lys can say)
- Private approach: "I represent a buyer with means (name: Callisto Danaea). He is prepared to buy a complete set of the Zodiac scrolls or commission them. He’ll pay the asking price, plus a 100 gp agent fee for arranging it. He can also offer an exchange—Eight Prime Arcana—for a direct swap. Discretion is required."
- If pressed about origin: "This is scholarly commerce — payment up front for authenticity and discretion. Tell me your price and we’ll speak plainly."

Negotiation & verification cues (GM/DC guidance)
- Persuasion to close a deal (convince a seller to meet promptly): DC 12–15
- Appraise / Arcana check to verify a scroll’s authenticity and whether it includes forbidden elements: DC 14 (success = identify mythic glyphs and possible forgeries)
- Investigation to determine whether a scribe can reproduce a scroll or whether an archivist has the skill: DC 12
- Sleight of Hand to conceal or swap a sensitive card/scroll during a crowded exchange: DC 14 vs passive Perception 13
- Stealth / Travel checks for moving artifacts from Scholar’s Row to Thornehold: Stealth DC 13; be prepared for Perception checks from followers/tails (Perception DC 13–15)

Risk notes / red flags for Lys
- Advertising the 13th sign or the specific card 23 openly attracts dangerous attention (Clerisy interest, rival collectors).
- Trading the Eight Prime Arcana publicly will draw notice—consider anonymous handoffs or trusted intermediaries.
- Commissioning a scribe/archivist to make all thirteen is time-consuming and may expose ritual sequences that Clerisy or rival parties could observe.
- If a seller demands public proof of funds or demonstration, avoid exposing the sensitive artifacts; use escrow, callisto’s letter of credit, or staged partial exchange.

Callisto’s ledger stub (for in-world record)
- Date: [fill in]
- Client: Callisto Danaea
- Agent: Lys Whisper
- Objective: Acquire 13 Zodiacal Scrolls (12 canon + 13th)
- Terms: Finder’s fee: 100 gp payable to agent on delivery. Callisto will match purchase price for scrolls; optional trade: Eight Prime Arcana offered as exchange collateral.
- Notes: Discretion requested. Sensitive item: possible Forbidden #13 (Ophiuchus). Use trusted couriers only.

Suggested constraints & secrets (GM cues)
- Callisto prefers to remain off-stage; he arranges through Lys to keep distance.
- Callisto expects the 13th, if found, to be handled differently — he may instruct that the 13th be copied and the original secured, or that the original be delivered to his workshop only.
- If the Clerisy learn a set exists, Callisto is at political risk; make this a lever for later scenes.

Player-facing short briefing (what to tell Lys / the party)
- You have been hired to obtain a complete set of the 13 Zodiacal scrolls for Callisto Danaea. He will pay a 100 gp finder’s fee plus cover the purchase price. He is also willing to exchange the Eight Prime Arcana to sweeten a deal. You must be discreet: the Clerisy and rival collectors prize these scrolls. Trading or displaying the 23-card or the 13th sign openly is dangerous.

Optional: GM hooks and escalation
- Rival collector plants false information to bait Lys into meeting someone who will try to steal the artifacts.
- Clerisy notice a pattern in purchases of star-moss and begin tracing buyers back to the scholar district.
- The scribe/archivist who can produce scrolls asks for favors (a rare reagent, introduction, or a task) instead of gold.

Do you want me to:
- Draft an in-world letter of credit/escrow note Callisto can sign for proof of funds?
- Generate a short courier contact NPC entry (name, one-liner, quick stats) for the Thornehold intermediary who arranged Lys's travel?
- Add this assignment as a ledger entry to Callisto's workshop file and create a corresponding /pasture/footsteps log template entry for the meeting?

If you'd like, I can also export this as a one-paragraph player brief for Lys (PM-ready) and a separate GM cue-card you can print for the table.
