Read‑aloud opener
A narrow townhouse sits in a quiet lane in the old scholar's quarter, a few winding streets and a long day's walk from Thornehold’s crowded markets. A brass-lettered sign reads "Danaea, Curios & Patterns" — tidy, private, deliberately small. A wind-chime of etched metal hangs by the door; the sound is faint, like something testing the air for meaning. A round glass dome peeks over the roofline, dark as a pupil.

Where it sits
- Quarter: Scholar's Row — a low-traffic district of bookbinders, mapmakers, and minor observatories several blocks and a short ride north of Thornehold proper. The location is deliberately removed from the tavern alleys and marketplaces.
- Relationship to Thornehold: Not adjacent. Lys Whisper and other intermediaries travel from Callisto’s workshop to Thornehold when conducting trades; visits are planned and rare rather than casual.
- Landmark cues: a small courtyard with clipped yew, a domed observatory above the roofline, and a faded painted mural of celestial lines over the back door.

Exterior details
- Façade: low, three-story brick with shutters; a single brass plaque and a curtained window on the ground floor that reads "By appointment." The shopfront is small — shelves of old maps and brass instruments visible through the glass.
- Entrances:
  - Front: compact shop door that opens onto Scholar's Row (public but rarely used for high-risk trades).
  - Back: service door to a private lane that connects to the district's service routes (not Veilstep Alley). Trusted couriers and appointed visitors use this door.
  - Cellar hatch: a stone lid in the courtyard leads down to the lower workshop; access is guarded and discreet.
- Discreet signals: a pale lantern in the courtyard signals a visitor is expected; a white handkerchief dropped from the balcony indicates the house is closed to strangers.

Interior layout (floor-by-floor)
- Ground floor — Curio Shop & Parlor
  - Small public room: shelves of old atlases, brass astrolabes, jars of preserved star-moss, and a counter for rare finds.
  - Hidden panel behind a shelf reveals a private passcode latch (mechanical with rune-inlaid tumblers).
  - A small guest chair and a low table with a copper tea set — Callisto meets trusted visitors here rarely.
- Mezzanine — Study & Pattern Ledger
  - Bricked alcoves hold stacks of inked folios and a wall-sized board of pinned diagrams. A pattern table (brass-inlaid, with sliding inlays and pin holes) dominates the room; this is where Callisto "assembles" expected artifacts from inferred patterns.
  - A glass-fronted cabinet stores prototype artifacts and explanatory notes labeled with dates and ciphered margins.
- Second floor — Observatory & Scriptorium
  - A small dome with a fixed brass orrery and an array of lenses and a mounted quill machine. The dome contains star-sheets, chalked constellations, and an adjustable projecting armature used for testing "pattern resonance."
  - An adjoining scriptorium for copying patterns into scrolls; faint chalk lines and compass marks stain the floor.
- Cellar — Workshop & Vault
  - Workbenches of hammered wood, a brazier for annealing, glassware, powders, a sealed alembic, and a locked iron chest (the vault) where meaningful artifacts are stored.
  - A narrow subterranean corridor runs to a discreet service lane used by the scholar district’s couriers — not Veilstep Alley. This lane links Callisto to a trusted courier network (different contacts than those in Thornehold).
  - Mechanical safeties and a mundane door with a warded iron ring prevent casual entry.

Security, wards, and defenses
- Mundane: heavy locks, a bolt when occupied, and a single trusted housekeeper/hand named "Gideon" (retired mapsman) who answers the door for daytime visitors.
- Magical: subtle anti-scrying glyphs on windows and a ward that muffles divinatory magic when the copper tea set is arranged on the pattern table (a small ritual Callisto performs nightly).
- Traps: the cellar has a mechanical delay well for would-be thieves — not lethal but slows and alarms the house. A soft clacker by the vault trips an enchanted moth that flares and blinds intruders.
- Social: Callisto keeps his guest list tight — appointments by letter or through trusted couriers (Lys being one of them). He prefers the quiet of sampled visitors.

How Callisto "produces" artifacts (player-facing explanation, short)
- Method: He studies gaps in surviving pattern-sets (star charts, ritual syntax, lost mythic sequences) and extrapolates the missing "node" — a thing that should exist if the pattern is whole. Using sympathetic forging — binding inked patterns, astral-synced annealing and a brief animating charm — he crafts an artifact that aligns with the inferred idea. Some of these ideas are harmless; some intersect with banned or dangerous glyphs.
- Tools & theatre: the pattern table, a sequence of inks (some mixed from star-moss), and the orrery’s phase alignment. He produces objects slowly; each item is time- and ritual-expensive, and each carries a faint echo of the pattern that birthed it.

Routine & habits
- Prefers late-night working when the district is quiet; most visitors are ushered in at dusk.
- Drinks a bitter cardamom tea when making final calculations.
- Keeps a ledger of purchases and clients under cipher; Lys is a named intermediary in several entries marked with discrete sigils.
- Rarely meets in public; uses intermediaries and leaves no paper trails when requesting dangerous components.

Allies, attendants & useful NPCs
- Gideon (house attendant): aged, careful, keeps the front and knows the ring of the backdoor. Quietly loyal.
- Pale courier network: small, unremarkable riders who never ask questions; they use the scholar-district service lanes to ferry goods to and from Thornehold.
- One minor construct (an ink-scribe automaton) that copies diagrams and envelopes notes into the pattern ledger.
- A contact in Thornehold (trusted intermediary) who coordinates timed handoffs when Lys travels to the Riven Stage.

Plot hooks & complications
- The artifacts Callisto makes attract attention: scholars, thieves, and the Clerisy. If the Clerisy catalog constructs as evidence of forbidden practice (especially cards >13 or glyph-23 derivations), Callisto is at risk.
- Callisto’s method is controversial — some claim he "fabricates" religion; others call him a visionary. This makes him both protected (by patrons who prize innovation) and hunted (by dogmatic orders).
- A rival collector might attempt to insert false pattern data into Callisto’s ledger to make him "produce" a dangerous artifact as a trap.
- Because the workshop is remote from Thornehold, Lys must travel with artifacts (or use couriers) — this adds risk and travel-related plot beats (interceptions, forged courier notes, or waylaying).
- The subterranean service lane is known to only a handful. If compromised, it endangers Callisto but not directly tie him to Thornehold’s alleys.

How to roleplay Callisto (RP cues)
- Manner: private, exacting, polite with a cool smile. He prefers to ask questions rather than answer them.
- Voice cues: measured, low, precise pronunciation; often corrects people’s terms for constellations and symbolic names.
- If surprised: he will shut off conversation and close the shutters; if threatened, he tries to bargain using information rather than force.
- If accused: he tilts his head, examines accuser’s hands, and replies with a scholarly dismissal: "You mistake inference for intent. That is a very useful confusion."

Player interaction options (how PCs can approach)
- Formal visit: send a sealed note or go through Lys. Expect controlled, appointed time, and a supervised parlor meeting.
- Covert entry: gain Gideon’s trust or use the scholar-lane access (requires a successful Stealth/Sleight or social engineering with a contact).
- Bargain: offer Callisto something he lacks — a rare reference, safe access to a lost scroll, or a trustworthy courier. He values obscurity and correctness.
- Confront: if the Clerisy bring charges, Callisto will shift to defensive, attempt to trade critical knowledge for time, or invoke patrons.

Short read‑aloud lines & cues
- To open a meeting: "You have stepped into more questions than answers. Sit and we will see which are worth the trouble."
- If offered a trade: "Patterns are honest when they are whole. What do you offer to complete this one?"
- If cornered: "Accusation is a blunt instrument. Try me with an argument."

GM notes
- Keep Callisto offstage when possible. His presence is most useful as a motive and a connection (he commissioned the cards and stands behind the trade).
- If the PCs pursue his workshop in-session, use the courtyard and cellar to create tension (close quarters, muffled sounds, the observatory dome above).
- Emphasize that Lys traveled from this remote location — the transit itself can create opportunities (tailing, intercepted couriers, forged notes).
- If the Clerisy are investigating, consider planting a thin, faint glyph on a visible object; it may draw scrutiny and push the conflict into the Riven Stage.

Questions for you
- Do you want Callisto to be physically present during the Riven Stage scene or remain off‑site (unseen patron)?
- Should his workshop be an accessible location for a later session (with a map / locked keys), or remain a narrative background detail?
- Would you like a short NPC stat block / social challenge DCs for Callisto and Gideon appended to this file?
