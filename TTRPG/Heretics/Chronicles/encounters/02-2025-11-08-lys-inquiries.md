Session: Archivist's Augury — Pre-scene inquiries  
Time (UTC): 2025-11-08 02:08:50  
Actor: Lys Whisper (PC)  
Recorder: Lorekeeper

Original text (verbatim)
"Lys begins asking around, 
Nialla Ashbough (herbalist in Elen’s Watch).  She doesn't delve into astrology.  Then to the Thomas Kree (no clue) and then to Hera Linn.  He says, actually he knows a fortune teller that practices both tarot and astrology, and she does seances at the inn, while her frriend Elara busks the audience.  They're in and out, always one step ahead of the clerisy, so you might have to check on a few different nights.  

Upside downside, Lys tries to decide whether he wants to grab the eight arcana before he meetss Elara, or after.  He finally decides to go back to Callisto and suggest that he has the Eight on hand for the trade."

Summary / Action log
- Lys canvassed local contacts in Thornehold for leads on zodiacal/astrological practitioners and possible sources for the 13 Zodiacal scrolls.
  - Nialla Ashbough (herbalist, Elen's Watch) — no knowledge of astrology sources; does not deal in astrological lore.
  - Tomas Kree — no leads / "no clue."
  - Hara (Hara Lin, manager of the Riven Stage) — reports knowing a fortune-teller who practices both tarot and astrology and who runs seances at the inn while Elara busks the audience. Hara notes they "are in and out, always one step ahead of the Clerisy" and suggests checking on several different nights.
- Decision: Lys weighed whether to present the Eight Prime Arcana to Aldra/Elara before meeting; ultimately decided to return to Callisto and report that he can have the Eight on hand for the trade (i.e., present them when the meeting is arranged).

Outcome / GM notes
- Confirmed contact: Hara Lin's tip linking tarot+astrology performance and seances to a fortune-teller who works with Elara — this aligns with planned Riven Stage scene.
- Intelligence quality: Hara's report implies the fortune-teller operates semi-nomadically at the inn and varies schedule; locating them may require checking multiple nights or asking Hara to call ahead.
- Risk vector: Hara's "in and out" wording suggests the fortune-teller and her associates are cautious of Clerisy patrols — increased chance of meeting being on-guard and quick to move.
- Player decision impact: Lys's decision to report back to Callisto and hold the Eight in reserve keeps options open:
  - Pros: Eight are available as leverage for trade or sale, reducing temptation to reveal them prematurely.
  - Cons: Transporting artifacts to the Riven Stage later introduces handling/transfer risk (theft, clerisy notice, or exposure during transit).
- Suggested GM triggers:
  - If the party chooses to surveil the inn on multiple nights, run a short time-check / passive Perception model to determine when the fortune-teller appears.
  - If Lys brings the Eight to the Riven Stage, decide beforehand whether they are obvious on the table or concealed (Stealth / Sleight of Hand opportunities).
  - Hara Lin may provide a contact or a "heads up" if the players ask for a favored night (could require a small favor or coin).

Resource / state changes
- No dice rolls recorded in this log entry.
- No artifacts exchanged or moved at this time.
- Narrative state: Lys pledged to inform Callisto that the Eight Prime Arcana can be made available for trade.

Follow-ups (GM TODO)
- If you want, I can:
  - Create a short "meeting schedule" mechanic for the GM (rolls to determine which nights the fortune-teller appears).
  - Draft Hara Lin's short permission/arrangement phrasing (what she says if asked to vouch for the party or arrange a night).
  - Append a short Stealth/Sleight DC recommendation for carrying the Eight into the Riven Stage (concealed vs displayed).
- Otherwise, this entry will be saved as-is to /pasture/footsteps/ for session continuity.
