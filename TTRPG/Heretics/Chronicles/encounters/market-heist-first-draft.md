# Market Heist — Opening Encounter

## Overview
The PCs (Corra Voss, Elara Keene, Lys Whisper) are hired—or independently planning—to steal a divine artifact from the Caelumbré market. The same artifact is being sought by Aldra Vey, a heretic wizard on the run. Complicating matters: Aldric Vale, a paladin investigator, is watching the market for signs of heretical activity.

This encounter introduces the PCs to each other (if they don't already know each other), establishes the campaign's central tensions, and provides multiple paths to success or failure.

## Setup

**Location**: Caelumbré Market, midday  
The market is a sprawling open-air bazaar in the city's merchant quarter. Stalls sell everything from fresh produce to religious icons. The target artifact is being sold by a merchant named Davan Crell, who claims it's a "decorative antique" but is actually a sacred relic from a forgotten pantheon.

**The Artifact**: The Hymnal Fragment  
A small, intricately carved stone tablet inscribed with musical notation in an ancient script. When sung aloud, the hymn is said to awaken memories of gods who have been erased. Davan doesn't know its true nature—he found it in a collapsed ruin and is selling it as curiosity.

**The Stakes**:
- Aldra Vey needs this artifact to decode the names in her codex.
- Lys Whisper was contracted to steal it (by whom is up to the GM—possibly the Grove, possibly a shadowy patron).
- Elara Keene recognizes the musical notation as similar to her forbidden hymn.
- Corra Voss may be hired separately, or simply along for the job.
- Aldric Vale is watching Davan's stall, suspecting heretics will come for it.

## Scene Flow

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (10-15 minutes)
The PCs arrive at the market separately or together. They can:
- **Observe the stall**: Davan is haggling with customers. The artifact is displayed prominently.
- **Spot Aldra Vey**: She's watching from a nearby café, nervously taking notes.
- **Spot Aldric Vale**: He's in the crowd, pretending to browse but clearly watching Davan's stall.

**Skill Checks**:
- Perception DC 12: Notice Aldra or Aldric
- Insight DC 13: Recognize that Aldric is law enforcement
- Investigation DC 14: Identify the artifact as genuinely old/magical

### Phase 2: The Approach (15-20 minutes)
The PCs decide how to acquire the artifact. Options include:
- **Stealth**: Lys attempts to pickpocket or distract-and-grab. (Sleight of Hand DC 15, contested by Davan's Perception +2)
- **Social**: Elara or Corra negotiate to buy or trade for it. (Persuasion DC 14, or lower if they offer something valuable)
- **Distraction**: Create a commotion to cover the theft. (Performance/Deception DC 13 to draw attention)
- **Collaboration**: Approach Aldra and work together.

**Complications**:
- If the PCs make too much noise (failed Stealth by 5+, obvious spellcasting), Aldric notices and approaches.
- If Aldra attempts her own heist simultaneously, she'll fumble it (she's not a rogue), creating chaos.

### Phase 3: Confrontation or Escape (15-20 minutes)
Depending on PC actions, this phase can go several ways:

**Option A: Aldric Confronts the PCs**  
Aldric approaches, hand on sword hilt, and demands to know what they're doing.
- **Combat**: If the PCs attack or flee aggressively, Aldric fights (see stat block). He'll call for city guards after 3 rounds.
- **Negotiation**: If the PCs talk, Aldric will question them. Persuasion DC 15 to convince him they're innocent, or Deception DC 16 to lie convincingly. If they mention the Silent Throne or question Pascal's God, he'll hesitate (Insight DC 14 to notice his doubt).
- **Intimidation**: DC 15 to make him back down, but this may have consequences later.

**Option B: Aldra Gets Caught**  
If the PCs don't act first, Aldra will attempt her own heist and fail. Aldric will arrest her. The PCs must decide:
- Rescue her (combat or distraction)
- Let her be taken (miss out on quest giver)
- Negotiate for her release

**Option C: Clean Getaway**  
If the PCs are clever and stealthy, they can acquire the artifact and leave without confrontation. But Aldra will approach them afterward, desperate for their help.

### Phase 4: Aftermath (5-10 minutes)
Once the encounter resolves, the PCs have the artifact (or not) and must decide what to do next.
- **If they have the artifact**: Aldra approaches and offers to pay (or trade information) for it. Elara may recognize the notation as related to her forbidden hymn.
- **If Aldra is arrested**: The PCs might plan a rescue, or learn that she'll be interrogated at the Clerisy's headquarters.
- **If Aldric is suspicious**: He'll keep an eye on the PCs, possibly following them or appearing in future encounters.

## Key NPCs

**Davan Crell** (Merchant)  
- AC 10, HP 4, no combat ability
- Unaware of the artifact's true value
- Will sell for 50 gp or trade for something interesting

**Aldra Vey** (Wizard NPC)  
- See character file
- Will offer 100 gp or information about the codex of forbidden names in exchange for the artifact

**Aldric Vale** (Paladin NPC)  
- See character file
- Primary antagonist for this encounter, potential future ally

## Outcomes & Consequences

**Success (artifact acquired, no arrest)**:
- PCs gain the Hymnal Fragment
- Aldra becomes an ally and quest giver
- Aldric is suspicious but has no proof

**Partial Success (artifact acquired, but Aldric is alerted)**:
- PCs gain the artifact but are now wanted by the Clerisy
- Aldric will pursue them in future encounters

**Failure (artifact not acquired, or PCs arrested)**:
- PCs must escape custody or face trial
- Aldra is arrested and the codex falls into Clerisy hands (bad for the world)

**Creative Solutions**:
- PCs convince Aldric to let them go by appealing to his crisis of faith
- PCs broker a deal between Aldra and Davan
- PCs destroy the artifact to keep it from either side

## GM Tips
- This encounter should feel tense but not hopeless. Multiple solutions exist.
- Emphasize choice: the PCs can fight, sneak, talk, or collaborate.
- Aldric is not a villain—he's a believer whose faith is cracking. Play him as sympathetic.
- If combat breaks out, keep it quick (3-5 rounds max) and cinematic.
- End with a hook to the next session: Aldra's codex, the Clerisy's investigation, or the awakening of divine memories.
