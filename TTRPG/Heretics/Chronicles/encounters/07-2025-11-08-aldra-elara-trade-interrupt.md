Session: Archivist's Augury — In-scene exchange and portent  
Time (UTC): 2025-11-08 14:16:01  
Actors: Lys Whisper (PC), Aldra Vey (NPC), Elara Keene (NPC/PC)  
Recorder: Lorekeeper

Exact words:
  Lys enters the room, and acknowledges the scented candles, and rich dark warmth of the place.  She says, "Are you here to have your fortune told?"

  He says, "Well, it turns out I'm a bit of a clairvoyant myself.  I have this feeling you might know something of the Zodiacal Scrolls.  Perhaps even have a set?"

  Aldra says, "I dabble.  But I sense you have no comprehension of what you seek."

  Lys tests her with Callisto's primary concern, "Perhaps not.  But If I'm to understand there are thirteen?"

  Aldra says, "Ah, yes.  The oft un-mentioned Ophiuchus.  The sun only spends a few days crossing it, but it does fit the pattern of the Zodiac."

  Lys says, "My client is interested in obtaining the whole set of thirteen."

  She says, "That's quite a bit of effort to inscribe these glyphs."

  Lys says, "He says, he wants to offer you the eight prime arcana in trade."

  She says, "Arcana...  As in tarot arcana?"

  Lys says, "Yeah...  Well, I was just kinda thinking trading numbers.  You give me 13, I give you eight."

  She says, "Ah...  Not much on the symbolism...  Interesting... Prime arcana you say?"  She counts on her fingers, thinking,   "So, like 2, the empress... 3, the high priestess, 5, the chariot, There's 7, 11, and 13 Death -- that's six, and where the Clerisy allowed deck ends.  Marking the end of life, and the beginning of eternal heaven.  You say you have eight, though?  17 and 23?  In secret circles, there are known to be 22 in total, but 14-22 are forbidden.  Do you have these cards?  What does the 23rd card look like?"

  "Honestly, I have no idea," says Lys.  "When I deliver a message, I treat it as none-of-my-business."  Lys reaches into his pack, and opens the hidden compartment.  "I guess, technically, these weren't sealed, but I haven't glanced at them."

  She lays the cards out on the table, including the forbidden 17, and the remarkable 23.  "ah, yes.  Card 17...  The star; or 'morning star' as it's sometimes called.  Referencing Lucifer, the accuser.  Once part of the righteous ones, but he fell in the moment he was tricked into making a false accusation.  Ever since then, Lucifer has been nothing but trouble.  And what do we have here?  Number 23...  The tree."

  The card is divided in the middle.  Green on bottom, blue on top.  Above, the trees branches unfold, with green bountiful leaves on the left, and decay and plague on the right.  Below the roots take up equal space underground, and bear similar signs of life and decay.  

  "This is a remarkable card.  It is representative of every idea.  Both true and false.  Both good and evil!"  

  Lys is partially relieved.  "So I just gotta know, will you make the trade?"

  "Of course." she says.  But instead of just handing him the documents, in a fit of pride, she spreads them out all over the table, showing the glistening ink connecting the stars, in their perfectly aligned patterns.  

  Lys impatiently waits though her explanation and names he's never heard or cared about "The snake bearers...  Ophiuchus, Moses, Nicodemus, Tyresias."

  Then Aldra is interrupted by an alarming change in Elara's ballad.  A warning.  Elara's eyes go back in her head in a moment of portentous clarity.  She immediately pulls a scroll from her pouch, and reads the incantation.  

Cleaned read‑aloud (GM use)
You step into the alcove where warm candlelight pools over parchment. Aldra looks up as you enter, polite curiosity in her eyes. "Are you here to have your fortune told?"

"I have a feeling you might know something of the Zodiacal Scrolls," you say. "Perhaps even a set?"

Aldra's smile is sharp and slow. "I dabble. But I sense you have no comprehension of what you seek."

When you ask about thirteen, she answers without hesitation: "Ah, yes. The oft un-mentioned Ophiuchus." The name slides across the table like an old coin.

You tell her Callisto will trade the Eight Prime Arcana. She fishes the cards from your hidden compartment and lays them out. Her face changes as she notes two of them. "Card 17 — the Star. The morning star. The accuser. And this... number 23." She taps the card with careful fingers. The Tree is split down the middle — bounty and rot above; roots mirrored below. She breathes, "It represents idea itself — both true and false."

She nods, spreads the Zodiacal scrolls across the table and says plainly, "Of course." As she begins to explain the patterns and name figures you've only half-heard, Elara's song twists. The room leans inward; her voice is a thread pulled taut. She reaches into her pouch, unfurls a scroll and begins to read in a tone that is equal parts song and command.

Action / Checks & mechanical suggestions
- Perception/Notice (audience/inquisitor): If anyone in the room is watching closely, allow a Perception check to notice Elara's change of mood and the scroll-reading. Suggested DC 12–13.
- Arcana/Religion (identify incantation): If a PC or inquisitor attempts to identify the ritual Elara is reading: Arcana or Religion DC 14 to recognize it as augury/ritualic incantation tied to divination; success reveals possible effects (delaying/protecting, summoning response from Aldra).
- Stealth / Discreet warning (Corra): If Corra is posted and wants to warn, use Stealth/Deception vs passive Perception (13) or active Perception of inquisitors (DC 13).
- Interrupting the incantation: The scroll-reading takes a brief window (suggest 2–3 rounds) to complete and take effect. If an inquisitor rushes in and disrupts Elara (attack, shove, or part curtain), require an opposed check: Performance/Concentration (Elara) DC 12 to maintain ritual vs physical disruption or Intimidation/Strength check by the interrupter (GM choose appropriateness).
- If Aldra was preparing a reactionary summon (e.g., Summon Modrons scroll), Elara's incantation functions as the ritual focus and will allow Aldra to trigger the scroll as soon as she senses Aldric or a qualifying doubt event. GM: treat Elara's reading as a "ritual charge" — if interrupted before charge completes, Aldra cannot cast the scroll as a reaction.

Immediate GM beats (recommended)
1. Pause and ask players for immediate reactions — give Aldric (if present) a short spotlight to act (investigate, step forward, test for auras).
2. Call for Perception/Arcana/Religion checks as appropriate based on who is paying attention.
3. If Corra is on lookout, give them a chance to warn discreetly now — treat Elara's incantation as an escalation trigger.
4. If inquisitors are nearby, have them react: move to the stage, request explanation, attempt to inspect scrolls (social or Investigation checks).
5. If Aldra chooses to use her Summon Modrons scroll, narrate a visible shimmering and prepare Monodrone mechanics (3 sequential obstacles tied to Augural Principles).

Outcomes to consider (branch seeds)
- Elara completes the incantation uninterrupted: the augury reaches a peak and will manifest a delayed protective effect (Monodrones, ritual blur, or crowd-affecting hush) when Aldric attempts to intervene.
- Elara is interrupted: ritual falters; Aldra loses the augmentation window — possible immediate vulnerability; inquisitors can inspect scrolls more easily and may seize evidence.
- Elara's reading is noticed by inquisitors (failed stealth/warning): they may immediately attempt arrest or rattle summoning beads (escalation).

Read-aloud cue-lines (use these in the moment)
- Aldra (laying scrolls): "These lines are old and picky. They won't be copied without sweat and ink."
- Aldra (on Card 23): "The Tree. It holds both bounty and rot. It is every idea at once."
- Elara (intoning, low): "Mark the line, and bind the shape; let silence keep what silence saves."
- Crowd cue (GM): "The room quiets as though a hand passed over the audience; even the clink of tankards dims."

State changes to record
- Inventory: Eight Prime Arcana presented (laid out — visible to Aldra; still concealed to others unless otherwise noted).
- Social: Aldra agrees to trade in principle; Elara initiates an incantation that may activate or prime Aldra's augury.
- Time: Ritual window opens (approx. 2–3 rounds) — treat as an active timeframe for interruptions or reactions.

GM logging & follow-up actions
- Record exact player quotes when they speak (already preserved above).
- If you want, I will append this entry to the session master log and continue to record subsequent beats (arrival of Aldric & inquisitors, Corra's warning, the monodrone manifestation, arrests, escapes).
- I can also prepare a one-page cue sheet showing: (a) Elara's musical signals and exact phrasing for "conceal" vs "welcome", (b) Aldra's threshold actions (when she uses Summon Modrons), and (c) suggested DCs for all likely checks in the next beats.

Would you like me to:
- Append this to the running session log master file now?
- Produce printable cue-cards (one for Elara, one for Aldra, one for Corra) with lines and check DCs?
- Prepare the Monodrone/augury mechanic in a one-line quick-reference so you can drop it into play instantly if Aldra triggers Summon Modrons?
