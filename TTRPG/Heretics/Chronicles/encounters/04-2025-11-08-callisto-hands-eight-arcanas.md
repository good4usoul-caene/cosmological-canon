Actor: Lys Whisper (PC) / Callisto Danaea (NPC)  
Recorder: Lorekeeper

Original text (verbatim)
"Callisto gives Lys eight large cards.  Lys eleccts not to look at them.  As he puts them in the hidden compartment of his satchel, Lys says, "So these are the cards that I hand over?"  "Yes" Callisto says.  "The Clerisy approved deck stops at the thirteenth Arcana, or the 6th prime.  It is the Death card.  The card that representss either eternal life in heaven, or eternal life in hell.   In ancient times, the arcana went all the way to 22.  But in my researches I've found a 23rd card.  The eitght prime.  It is the reliable standard that I've added to my deck to make my auguries sound.""

Cleaned read‑aloud (GM use)
Callisto produces eight large cards and lays them on the table for a moment. Lys refuses to look, tucking the cards into the hidden compartment of his satchel. "So these are the cards I hand over?" he asks.

"Yes," Callisto replies. "The Clerisy-approved deck stops at the thirteenth Arcana—the Death card, the sixth prime. It marks the line between eternal life and final judgment. Long ago the arcana ran to twenty-two, and in my studies I have found evidence of a twenty-third. This is the eighth prime. I include it in my deck as a reliable standard to strengthen auguries."

Summary / Action log
- Callisto transfers eight large arcana cards to Lys; Lys deliberately does not examine them and stores them in a hidden satchel compartment.
- Callisto gives a concise provenance/lecture: Clerisy doctrine recognizes up to the thirteenth Arcana; older systems extended higher; Callisto claims to have discovered a 23rd card (card 23 — "the eighth prime") which he uses to bolster auguries.
- This reinforces Callisto's role as both patron and a scholar who produces/possesses artifacts that skirt or exceed accepted Clerisy limits.

Outcome / GM notes & implications
- Narrative weight: The physical transfer ties Callisto directly to the items; if the Clerisy trace the Eight, Callisto's exposure increases.
- Player choice: Lys choosing not to inspect the cards preserves plausible deniability and an intentional distance between agent and patron.
- Evidence & risk: If the cards are displayed or otherwise observed by Clerisy or inquisitors, the provenance (23rd card, items beyond 13) could be taken as evidence of forbidden practice.
- Roleplay hook: Callisto's assertion about a 23rd card (the “eighth prime”) can be used later to justify unique augural effects or as a plot seed for scholars and inquisitors alike.

Suggested mechanical prompts (optional)
- If a PC attempts to inspect the cards surreptitiously: Sleight of Hand DC 14 vs passive Perception 13 (or active Perception if someone is watching).
- If an inquisitor identifies the cards in public: Investigation/Religion DC 14 to recognize nonstandard arcana and flag them as suspicious.
- If a player requests, Callisto may provide a signed patron token (letter of credit) to vouch for funds; that token can grant situational Persuasion advantage (+2 to Persuasion) when negotiating with sellers (GM discretion).

Follow-ups / GM TODO
- Do you want a signed in-world patron token that Lys can carry (text + mechanical suggestion)?
- Would you like this event added to Callisto’s ledger file as a logged outgoing (so the connection is explicit in the world files)?
- Want a short physical description and image cue for the Eight cards (appearance, filigree, any visible glyphs) to present at the table if players later decide to examine them?
