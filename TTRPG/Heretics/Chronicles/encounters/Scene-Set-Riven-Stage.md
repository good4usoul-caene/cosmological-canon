Read-aloud opener (short)
The Riven Stage squats between a pair of narrow workshops like a throat between two shoulders — a wide carved door, a painted sign half-lost to soot, and a lantern that buzzes with a dull, constant light. Music leaks through the cracks, and every face in the doorway looks like it has something to hide or something to sell. The smell of fried bread and oil-matted wool hangs in the air. Tonight, the Stage promises spectacle — and hidden business.

Exterior (what the players see and hear)
- Street: cobbled lane, gutter-running with rain from earlier, merchant carts pushed to the side, a pair of brazier-sellers arguing two doors down.
- Landmarks: Veilstep Alley entrance to the stage’s side door (a narrow, lamp-lit alley with visible workshop doors and a faded sign for Tomas Kree’s inn two buildings away).
- Crowd: A mix of dockworkers, apprentices, and a few city-watch types in plain clothes. Conversations are loud — laughter, a hawker calling bargains, clink of tankards.
- Cues of approach: Heavy boots with the Clerisy insignia click differently from the common tread; a murmur drops when robes brush the cobbles.

Interior layout — quick map (mental)
- Front bar & audience floor: tables clustered, stools, stage at the far wall, service path to the kitchen.
- The Riven Stage: raised platform (2–3 feet) with simple curtains, space enough for a performer and a small band.
- Aldra’s alcove: a curtained niche to the right of the stage, accessible via a short corridor from the side door. The curtain is thick tapestry — ornate, embroidered with safe-looking geometric knots — concealing a small table, a chest with hidden compartments, and a single folding chair.
- Side door & service passage: behind the alcove a side passage leads to Veilstep Alley; false panels and stacked crates provide hiding places and quick exits.
- Manager’s box (Hara Lin): small office behind the bar with a peephole to the stage and a key to the side door.

Where people are placed (suggested staging)
- Elara: on-stage, center-left, playing a lute or small harp. Her performance draws the crowd forward, rhythmically controlling attention.
- Aldra: seated in the alcove, just off-stage. She accepts clients at the curtain’s edge and can be signaled by Elara.
- Lys: approaches the side entrance and moves into the alcove for the trade or sits at a shadowed table near the stage.
- Corra: posted at the side door in Veilstep Alley, able to see the street and the stage door.
- Aldric & Inquisitors: enter via the front or side, depending on how you want tension to build. They are immediately noticeable by posture and the insignia on their cloaks.

Separation between stage and fortune-room (how to portray)
- Visual separation: thick tapestry curtain and a short corridor — not a locked room, but private enough to take quiet exchanges. The curtain muffles sound; performance noise masks small gestures.
- Practical separation: Aldra’s table is placed so that a client can sit facing the room while the crowd faces the stage. A single low shelf and a hanging brazier keep the two spaces partially sighted but not exposed.
- Tactical notes: the curtain can be drawn quickly or left partly open for an ambiguous reveal. If a clerisy inspects too closely, they will need to part the curtain and enter the alcove (a simple threshold that increases tension).

Elara Keene — how she interacts with the crowd
- Performance style: warm voice, practiced laugh, call-and-response phrasing to keep attention. Her songs are infectious: a few words repeated, a rising chord that signals a breath, a step that invites laughter.
- Masking gestures: Elara times a particular flourished chord or a held breath at the third beat to coincide with a hidden movement (a hidden handoff, a tucked satchel, a whispered signal).
- Language & mood: uses familiar tavern jokes and local references to put the crowd at ease. When needed she can make the crowd look inward and quiet with a lullaby or rile them with a jaunty drinking song.
- Stage cues she uses for the operation:
  - "Hold the third chord" — Elara sustains a note, hiding a quick motion at the table.
  - "One last refrain" — signals a short, rehearsed distraction (a staged stumble, a tossed coin).
  - Soft humming under breath — masks low-voice incantations Aldra might use without fully revealing ritual.
- If threatened: she increases tempo to create chaos or drops to a single held note to freeze the crowd, depending on whether she wants cover to escape or space to shield a person.

Sound and sensory beats to use during play
- Use pounding applause and a lute’s bright note to hide the sound of a satchel being unzipped.
- The tapestry curtain muffles whispers but creaks when parted — use that sound as a tension cue.
- Candle smoke and the smell of burnt sugar mark the stage; a sudden sniff of incense can signify Aldra performing a small charm.

Cue lines (read-aloud options)
- Opening the scene: "The Riven Stage is full tonight; it sways with tired laughter and the kind of stories taverns swallow. From the side, a curtain breathes over a secret."
- Elara to crowd (cheerful): "You lot — one last song before the moon takes the ale! Come close, and mind your pockets for the tune!"
- Elara to Aldra (quiet, musical): "Hold the third chord. I’ll draw them left on the chorus."
- Stage-to-entrance hint (for Corra spotting approach): "A pair of cloaks with thin silver thread — two that move like an idea being argued."

GM hints & beats
- If you want tension slow: let Aldric arrive and speak before the curtain opens. Let him ask questions; allow roleplay to build suspicion.
- If you want tension sharp: have Corra spot the inquisitors and intentionally warn, forcing immediate decisions mid-performance.
- When the beads are rattled: a metallic clack echoes; the crowd hears a steadier tread, and every head turns toward the door.

Use this sheet to set the scene aloud, place the NPCs, and run Elara’s stage choreography for masking and timing. If you want, I can format a one-page "GM cue card" with only the lines and beat-timings for quick reference during play.
