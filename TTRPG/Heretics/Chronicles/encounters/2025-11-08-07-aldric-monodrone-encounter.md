Exact words:
  Temporal Transition.  Aldric Vale’s story begins a few days before the previous scene.

  Inquisitor Mara Thes, Inquisitor Joren Kade.  and Aldric Vale have been coming to the Riven for a few nights now.  

  There has been suspicion of Lucifer invocation and each night this week, Aldric has come in to the Riven and you’ve done a little “divine sense” and for the most part things have passed his inspection but tonight is different.  He comes in, and during a pause performance Aldric uses his divine sense and detects in the singer on stage a chromatic pattern of influences inconsistent with God.  

  He casts his cantrip version of God’s Augury.  
  God says “Believe in me and have eternal life after your dead.”  
  “Ah yes.  The form letter.” Aldric thinks to himself.  “That response again, okey dokey:  God’s busy and can’t reply at this time. Don’t worry guy!  You’ll be fine.”

  Joren asks, “so what do you see?”  

  “Well, I got pretty much the same answer I always get for my augury, so I’m not sure which way to play this.”

  “Well, if she’s a heretic, we have to arrest her,” Joren says.

  “Can we wait until she’s done dancing?  She’s not bad.” says Aldric.

  “She’s a source of temptation.  If people are tempted, they will doubt.  If they doubt they’ll spend eternity in hell.  We must prune the branch.”  

  “Okay,” Aldric sighs.  “You go for it.”

  Joren and Mara move into place at the sides of the stage.  Of course, Alara sees there’s a problem, and changes her song, introducing a subtle beat of alarm, which Aldra hears.  

  Aldra reaches into her pack and draws out a scroll, and reads the incantation.

  In the same moment, Joren becomes aware of the curtain, and quickly brushes them aside. He gasps at the heresy:  The constellations and cards are laid out on the table, Joren sees inside the beaded curtains and curses, “Forbidden glyphs!” 

  Mara rushes Elara, and Joren draws his blade, to menace Lys and Aldra.  They rush in thinking that Aldric has their back, but something altogether strange is happening to him.  Three strange apparitions have appeared before Aldric.  They are little spheres with arms and legs.  Mechaanical looking things.  


  Round 1:
  To Aldric, the first mechanical figure offers a proposal.
  “Accept principle 1, Doubt is a crime against God, and I will step aside.
  Accept principle 2, Proof of a crime may may mean proof of a concept.” and you must fight me to break your former principle.

  Aldric draws his sword and replies…  “Huh?  Shut your face-hole!”  
  Hit:  11 damage.  Monodrone is sliced practically in half.

  Joren and Mara are menacing their targets.  Offering a them a chance to surrender and face arrest.  Mara begins to shake his summoning beads.  

  Aldra tries to calculate what to do next.
  Lys, thinking, “All I need is right there.”  He attempts to swipe up the 13 laid out constellations, but only manages to grab four.
  Elara: puts hands up, trying to calm the situation, taking a stance of surrender, and somewhat…  sensual submission, distracting Mara from his summoning beads.  

  Round 2:
  To Aldric, the second mechanical figure offers a proposal
  “Accept principle 1:  Faith is belief in what is unseen, and I will step aside.
  “Well Duh,” Aldric says, as the mechanical figure finishes (unheard)
  “Or accept principle 2:  Faith must have hope.” and you must fight me to break your former principle.
  The mechanical figure steps aside.

  Joren: Rushes the table and knocks it over, saying “You will not have these forbidden glyphs!”
  Mara moves forward toward Elara, who has put her hands forward in a gesture of submission or surrender.

  Lys shouts “YOU HAVE INTERRUPTED OUR ROLE-PLAYING GAME!” pulls his shortsword and attacks Joren.  Hits for 6 points (10 left)
  Aldra weighs the cost of violence and with reluctance, elects to draw her dagger.  Moving into position to flank for the next round.

  Mara begins to grapple and cuff Elara.  She seems to misunderstand his cues though, and ends up, at the moment, unbound by the cuffs.  She graciously apologizes and offers to try again.

  Round 3:  
  To Aldric, the third mechanical figure offers a proposal.
  “Accept principle 1: Doubt is crime against God, and I will step aside.”
  Or Accept principle 2: Without Branches, a tree cannot grow or take root”, and you must fight me to break your former principle!
  Aldric says, “THIS THING IS CONFUSING ME WITH WORDS!  WORD-TALKING!  SHEESH!”  with that, he swings at the mechanical apparition, though the blade goes wide.
  The mechanical figure bows quickly, acknowledging the fight is on, and thrusts back, but does not get through Aldric’s heavy armor.

  Joren strikes at Lys, and Lys takes a bad wound.  He’s still in the fight, but barely.
  Aldra casts a divination “true strike” which doesn’t have any provable phenomenological effect, but with her twin views of the future, she knew the wound would not have gone as deep if she hadn’t divined.  Joren takes 4 pts damage, (6 left.)
  With the distraction, Lys finds a weak spot in Joren’s defenses and drops him, rendering him bleeding out on the floor.

  Elara still seems confused about just how to hold her wrists for Mara’s binding.  Effusively apologetic.  “I’m so sorry, I’m such a ditz.  You want me to hold my arms how again?”

  Round 4: 
  Aldric strikes at the third mechanical figure again, this time causing it to crumble to the floor, it’s clockwork gears winding to a halt.

  Aldra quickly moves to the back of the room, opening a hidden door.  Lys quickly gathers his papers.

  Elara, sensing that Joren has been effectively dispatched says to Mara, “I’m terribly sorry, I just remembered, I have a prior engagement..”  She breaks Mara’s grapple and runs.

  Round 5.  
  Mara, finding his hands empty, calls out to Aldric, “Come on, get after them, and runs into the room.  But he arrives after the secret door has been closed.  He does not immediately see how they escaped.

  Aldric, finding Joren bleeding on the floor, says, “Oh.  This is my thing”  He puts a finger on him and says “POINT”.  

  Joren groans.  

  “Aldric says, feeling better?  On a scale of, say, 1-16, how do you feel?”

  “Probably no better than a one, doc.”

Canonical clarification:
  Three monodrones manifested as a result of the spell cast from Aldra's scroll at the beginning of the encounter.  The first and third monodrone were attacked and killed by Aldric.  The second, bearing the pre-existing notion "Faith is belief in things you don't see." was acknowledged by Aldric, "Duh! I know that."  It stepped aside, and remained intact, and passive for the duration of the spell; approximately 10 combat rounds.  The others laid in crumpled heaps until the duration was complete.

  - Why this is important:  Aldric neither clearly heard, nor accepted the heretical principle "Faith requires hope." This is a devastating principle to belief in Pascal's God, as no rational person would "hope" God's only role is to guard the gate of heaven with such a stupid requirement.

- Canonical refinement:  Lys gathered a few more Zodiacal scrolls before the escape, including Ophiuchus.  Meanwhile, Aldra grabbed cards 17, and 23.  Between the two of them, they left some problematic glyphs; constellations and tarot cards, but none of the deeply heretical glyphs.  Cards 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 remain to be discovered by Mara, and reported to the Clerisy, unless Aldric stops them.  These cards might be traced back to Callisto.  

- Canonical Clarification: Callisto and Lys have no receipts for the Clerisy to find.  

- TBD: Did Aldra or Elara leave anything else behind in their rush to flee?  Purses, equipment?

GM notes (do not change the canonical transcript above)
- Canonical: the verbatim transcript above is the table-recorded, canonical account of what occurred during the temporal-transition beat in-session.
- Immediate recorded mechanicals (as the table ran them, corrected):
  - Monodrones: Three manifested via Aldra/Elara's augury trigger.
    - Monodrone 1: Attacked and destroyed during Round 1 (Aldric hit; crumpled heap).
    - Monodrone 2: Bore the principle "Faith is belief in things you don't see." Aldric verbally acknowledged the principle ("Duh! I know that.") and did not attack it. It remained passive and intact for the duration of Aldra's augury (~10 combat rounds) and did not behave aggressively.
    - Monodrone 3: Engaged and destroyed by Aldric by Round 4 (crumpled heap).
  - Aldric: Did not accept any monodrone principle as a narrative "Doubt/Compromise" mark; he destroyed Monodrones 1 and 3 and acknowledged (but did not fight) Monodrone 2.  
    - Clarification:  He neither heard, nor accepted the heretical principle "Faith requires hope." which is a devastating requirement for Pascal's God, as no rational person would "hope" God's only role is to guard the gate of heaven with such a stupid wager.
  - Joren Kade (Inquisitor): Took multiple hits and was reduced to bleeding-out condition by the end of the skirmish (left bleeding unconscious on the floor). Recorded HP changes in-table: took 4 damage from Aldra's intervention (down to 6), then subsequently was dropped by Lys (bleeding out).
  - Lys Whisper (PC): Managed to seize 4 of the 13 Zodiacal scrolls during Round 1; later gathered papers and escaped with Aldra through a hidden door when it opened. Suffered a "bad wound" from Joren's attack but remained alive and mobile.
  - Aldra Vey (NPC): Read an incantation to prime augury, then opened a hidden exit and evacuated with scrolls when the opportunity arose.
  - Elara Keene (NPC): Distracted Mara, then disengaged and fled once the skirmish favored Lys/Aldra.
  - Inquisitor Mara Thes (Inquisitor): Attempted restraints; grappled/released Elara; pursued but failed to intercept the escaping party before the door was shut.
  - Summoning beads: Mara shook beads in Round 1 (escalation trigger). No explicit reinforcements were recorded arriving in this canonical log.
    - Clarification: Mara took out the summoning beads but was distracted by Elara Keene, whose immediate "surrender" made him pause from calling reinforcements.
- Inventory/state changes (table-canonical):
  - Of the 13 Zodiacal scrolls laid out, Lys obtained 4 (physical possession noted at escape).
  - The Eight Prime Arcana remained with Lys (hidden satchel) and were not publicly confiscated during the skirmish.
  - Joren is bleeding and requires immediate aid (medicine/stabilization) to prevent death.
- Narrative consequences to flag for future sessions:
  - The Clerisy have evidence that a meeting with forbidden glyphs occurred at the Riven Stage; Joren was engaged and wounded — the incident will draw report, inquiry, and possible escalation from the Clerisy.
  - Callisto’s involvement is still traceable in earlier logs (transaction for the Eight Prime Arcana). If the Clerisy trace the passage of cards or the escape route, larger political consequences may occur.  
  - Aldra and Elara escaped via a secret exit; their immediate whereabouts are unknown but likely to be in Veilstep Alley network or staged safehouses.
  - Lys currently holds 4 Zodiacal scrolls and the Eight Prime Arcana (hidden) — he is now a higher-value target for pursuers.
- Suggested immediate GM bookkeeping:
  - Log Joren's condition and prioritize an NPC stabilization check or faction reaction (Clerisy reporting / internal investigation).
  - Mark the Riven Stage as a hot site: increased clerisy patrols, inquisitorial visits, and potential search warrants.
  - Note Callisto's ledger/transaction as politically sensitive—consider how the Clerisy may leverage network tracing (couriers, receipts).
