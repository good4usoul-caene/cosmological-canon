---

Session: Archivist's Augury — Pre-scene agreement  
Time (UTC): 2025-11-08 02:14:25  
Actor: Lys Whisper (PC) / Callisto Danaea (NPC)  
Recorder: Lorekeeper

Original text (verbatim)
"Lys says "Hey, I have a line on someone who is really likely to make the trade, but I'm not sure exactly what night I'm going to find them, so I'm hoping that I can grab those 8 prime arcan in advance.

Callisto hesitates, then he says, just a moment.  He pulls open a tarot deck, and shuffles, laying them out.  Meditates a moment.  Reads the cards.  Listens.  After five minutes, he nods.  "I accept your proposal.  The cards seem to suggest the plan will work, or if doesn't, it at least won't be your fault.""

Cleaned read‑aloud (GM use)
Lys leans forward. "I have a line on someone likely to make the trade, but I don't know which night. I'd like to bring the Eight Prime Arcana in advance."

Callisto pauses. He reaches for a worn tarot deck, shuffles, and lays the cards out on the table. He studies them in silence, fingertip tracing brass inlay. After a long moment he closes his eyes, then nods once. "I accept your proposal," he says quietly. "The cards suggest the plan will work—or, if it does not, that it will not be on you."

Summary / Action log
- Lys proposes procuring the Eight Prime Arcana in advance to ensure readiness when the fortune-teller contact appears.
- Callisto performs a brief tarot consultation and gives conditional approval: he accepts the plan and authorizes Lys to proceed with acquiring/bringing the Eight Prime Arcana for the trade.
- The tarot reading is recorded as an in-world omen/approval, not a mechanical guarantee; Callisto frames this as reassurance and transfers responsibility for the next steps to Lys.

Outcome / GM notes
- Narrative outcome: Callisto's acceptance formalizes Lys's task. Lys is now explicitly authorized to carry the Eight Prime Arcana into negotiations on Callisto's behalf.
- In-world consequence: Callisto's blessing may be used as proof of patronage if discretion is required (a sealed note or a mention of Callisto's name may open doors), but it also creates a stronger connection between Callisto and the eventual transaction—if the Clerisy trace the trade back, Callisto's exposure increases.
- Mechanical/roleplay hooks (optional):
  - If players request, Callisto can provide a signed note of credit or a discreet token confirming funds; treating that as a social asset can give +2 to Persuasion checks when arranging a sale (GM discretion).
  - The tarot moment can become a foreshadowing device: consider using a small die-roll seed later if the table wants fate-ish consequences tied to the reading.
- Risk: Carrying the Eight Prime Arcana between Scholar's Row and Thornehold increases the chance of interception or theft; call this out to the players during play.

Follow-ups / GM TODO
- Offer to draft a short in-world letter of credit or patron token from Callisto that Lys can present to sellers (if you want mechanics for persuasion/credibility).
- If desired, append a ledger update to Callisto's workshop file noting the formal acceptance and the new instruction to Lys.
- Consider whether Callisto provided any small ritual/warding advice when signing off (none recorded here). If he did, log it.

If you'd like, I can:
- Produce a one-line patron token (in-world note) Callisto signs that Lys can carry as proof of funds.
- Add a short mechanical bonus to negotiation rolls tied to that token and draft the precise text so you can hand it to the player in session.
- Append this entry to Callisto's ledger in his workshop file for continuity.
