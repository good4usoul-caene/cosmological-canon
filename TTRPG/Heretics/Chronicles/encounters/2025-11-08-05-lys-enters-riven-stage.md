Session: Archivist's Augury — Waiting at the Riven Stage  
Time (UTC): 2025-11-08 13:37:53  
Actor: Lys Whisper (PC) / Elara Keene (NPC/PC) / Aldra Vey (NPC)  
Recorder: Lorekeeper

Original text (verbatim)
"Callisto pays up front and Lys decides to spend some of that not-yet earned bounty by staying at the Riven, while he waits for this bard to show up.  Then one night, she appears, sort of a costume that's half belly-dancer, and half gypsy, performing mystically and sensually on the stage.  Lys rolls a 12 on the perception check so Aldra is concealed from your gaze.  In fact he nearly forgets that he's supposed to do a job.

Eventually, though, a silent acknowledgment from Aldra informs Elara that Lys ought be permitted entry.  Elara's music weaves a different pattern.  One of welcoming, instead of concealment.  And Lys shakes his head, sees the opening through the beaded curtains.  With a nod to the performer, he parts them and enters."

Cleaned read‑aloud (GM use)
You wait through a handful of nights until, one evening, a woman steps onto the stage: beads, bells, a costume that half-whirls belly-dancer and half-claims the wanderer's garb. Her music undulates—sensual and exact—pulling the room toward her.

You watch the stage and the curtains. Aldra sits off to the side, tucked away from the crowd; tonight you do not notice her at first (Perception 12). The music is a small, living thing; for a moment you almost forget why you came.

Then a small thing: Aldra nods once, barely; Elara falters, shifts a phrase, and the tune melts into a welcoming line. The beat softens. The crowd leans forward in invitation rather than threat. Through the beadwork of the curtain you see the alcove's opening. You give a quiet nod back to the performer, reach aside the beads, and step into the alcove.

Action / Checks recorded
- Perception check (Lys) — roll: 12. Result: Aldra remains concealed from Lys’s immediate notice.
- No other checks were rolled or required at this moment; Aldra's signal is subtle and nonverbal.

Outcome / GM notes & implications
- Entry granted: Aldra's silent acknowledgment and Elara's musical cue constitute a prearranged signal allowing Lys to approach the fortune-telling alcove without raising alarm.
- The change in music (concealment → welcome) functions as an in-world social "green light"; if inquisitors are present and watching the area closely, they might notice the shift — treat that as a potential Perception trigger if the players act clumsily.
- Lys entering the alcove with the Eight Prime Arcana concealed in his satchel preserves plausible deniability (unless he chooses to lay them out).

Roleplay & sound cues (for the GM to perform)
- Elara's concealment motif: quick, syncopated plucks; light percussion that makes hands look occupied.
- Elara's welcoming motif: a sustained minor-to-major resolution on the third beat, a low hum that invites listeners inward.
- Aldra's acknowledgment: a single, slow fingertip brushing the ledger edge or a barely-seen tilt of the head toward the curtain.
- Beaded curtain: creak/soft rattle when parted—use as a tension cue.

Suggested mechanical follow-ups (if you want to enforce checks)
- If inquisitors or attentive patrons are watching the alcove and a player attempts a discrete approach: opposed checks — Lys Stealth or Deception vs crowd-watchers' passive Perception (suggest DC 13).
- If a player tries to display the cards on the table as part of negotiation immediately upon entry: Sleight of Hand DC 14 to reveal/withdraw without attracting attention vs inquisitors' active Perception if present (Perception DC 13–15).

State changes to record
- Location change: Lys moves from audience/front bar area into Aldra's alcove.
- Social state: Aldra has granted permission for Lys to engage; Elara is actively assisting the handoff by changing performance.
- Inventory: Eight Prime Arcana remain concealed in Lys's satchel (no inspection performed).

Suggested next log actions
- If the negotiation begins, record the first visible presentation of artifacts (time, exact wording, any checks).
- If Corra gives an alley warning or if Aldric/Clerisy arrive while Lys is in the alcove, log the warnings, rolls, and immediate reactions.
- If anyone inspects the cards or the scrolls become visible, note Investigation/Religion checks and outcomes.

Would you like me to:
- Append this entry to a running session master-log file, or
- Create a brief in-character note you can hand the Lys player to remind them of their concealed status and Callisto's instruction, or
- Produce quick, printable cue-cards for Elara and Aldra that you can use at the table for consistent performance signals?
