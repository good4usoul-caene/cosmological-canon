## Characters:  Callisto (Jonathan) and Aldric Vale (Jim)
 - Callisto is seeking an adult man for adoption by Draupada to be tasked with the assassination of Drona.
 - Aldric is a Clerisy Paladin, who doesn't care for the way Drona came into power through a coup.

## Deck
 - Aldric is handed a Clerisy approved Tarot Deck to shuffle, only containing the first 13 major arcana.  (Later, during Corra Voss's reading, it's discovered that 17-"the Star" was actually in the deck as well.)

## Question:  Should Aldric Vale be adopted by Draupada 
Callisto explains first, the shuffle.  "You can either choose to align the cards all top to bottom ahead of time, or you can shuffle with alternating them.  If you align the cards, you may choose whether the reading is about the elementals Earth (Sensing), Air (Perceiving), Water (Feeling), and Fire (Extraverted Charisma), of if you would prefer the containment version:  Pentacles (Symbolic Intuition), Swords (Judgment), Cups (Thinking), and Wands (Intraverted Charisma).  

Aldric checks the facing of the cards and says "Looks like they are already mixed up.  I'll just keep them that way."  He shuffles a few times, turning one side 180 degrees with each shuffle.  

## Present:  Queen of Pentacles
Callisto:  The first card is your **present**.

Aldric decides that he will view the cards upside down and make them rightside up for Callisto.  He puts out the **Queen of Pentacles**.  "This card represents nurturing with symbolic food.  In part it probably represents your desire to provide comfort through belief in God.  To help people with their fears of death by assuring them that their belief in God will be enough for eternal heaven."

## Past
The next card is your **Past**.  Aldric draws the six of cups.  "This is community of thought.  Your religion is based on a very logical idea, namely that if you believe in God, but you're wrong, nothing bad happens.  But if you don't believe in God and you're wrong, you would suffer terribly.  The logical conclusion is to believe in God, for it seems very safe.  This card represents the shared community you have with those who share that idea."

## Future
The next card is you **Future**.  Aldric draws the High Priestess.  "This could be a strong sign that you shouldn't make a drastic decision right now to be adopted by Draupada.  The High Priestess is a sign that you should feel comfortable in taking your time, sitting in the question, patiently...  Not making any rash decisions.  Inaction may be your most mature form of action."

## Reason behind question
The next card is your reason behind the question.  Aldric draws the 9 of Pentacles.  "This card represents an independence of symbolic wealth.  In conjunction with your nature of nurturing with your symbolic wealth (queen of pentacles) and your community of thought (6 of cups), it might represent that you have something of your own to offer."


## Potential behind question
The last card of our set is the potential in the question.  Aldric draws the seven of cups.  "Reflection about logic... This could, perhaps represent a questioning about the logic by which you give comfort to your flock, and perhaps the arena wherein you offer comforts.  Such as it is, God only offers the comfort of heaven once death comes.  The question of adoption by Draupada might make you become more focused on the world of the living."
