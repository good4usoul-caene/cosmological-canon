# ⚖️ Aldric Vale — Paladin (Variant Human, Noncanonical notes)

One-line pitch  
- Aldric Vale — Oathbound to the Silent Throne: a devoted paladin whose oath grants power and bonds conscience. The Throne is silent; his choices shape whether that silence becomes chain or freedom.

Noncanonical: Oats vs Oath (a short table-side note)
- Jim thought it said "oats" and brought porridge. Aldric respects breakfast: a bowl of warm oats is an oath to oneself — nourishing, steady, and quietly honorable. But an Oath is a promise sworn to something beyond hunger: a vow that shapes a life.
- If you want a light moment at the table: Aldric can always offer his porridge to a hungry villager and say, with a half‑smile, "My oats keep me honest, my oath keeps them safe." Use it to break tension, remind the party he's human, and to make the serious bits feel lived-in.
- (Noncanonical aside: this is for flavor and laughs; it has no mechanical effect unless the table wants to add a porridge‑based boons rule.)

Oath (chosen player line)
- "I swear to protect the innocent with my life."

Core stats (Standard Array + Heroic; Variant Human applied)
- Base (before racial): STR 16, DEX 10, CON 13, INT 8, WIS 12, CHA 15  
- Variant Human: +1 CON, +1 CHA; feat: Lucky  
- Final scores: STR 16 (+3), DEX 10 (+0), CON 14 (+2), INT 8 (-1), WIS 12 (+1), CHA 16 (+3)

Derived numbers
- Level: 1  
- HP: 1d10 (max 10) + CON mod (+2) = 12 HP  
- AC: Chain mail (16) + Shield (+2) = 18 AC (if using chain mail + shield)  
- Proficiency bonus: +2  
- Initiative: +0 (DEX 10)  
- Speed: 30 ft

Attacks
- Longsword: +5 to hit (Prof +2 + STR +3), Damage 1d8 + 3 slashing (versatile 1d10 +3)  

Class features (Paladin L1)
- Divine Sense: 1 + CHA modifier per long rest → CHA 16 (+3) → 4 uses per long rest  
- Lay on Hands: pool of 5 HP (L1) — touch healing, not a spell; visible and potentially notable in public.

Variant Human: Lucky feat (summary)
- Lucky (feat): You have 3 luck points. Whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20 and choose which die to use. Also, when an attack roll is made against you, you can spend one luck point to roll a d20 and choose whether the attacker uses the attacker's roll or yours. Regained on a long rest.
- Notes: Lucky is a strong, flexible defensive/mechanical tool—great for a frontliner who must survive tight spots and for mitigating dramatic oath-tests.

Suggested skills & proficiencies
- Saving throws: STR, CHA (paladin defaults)  
- Suggested skill proficiencies: Athletics, Persuasion (or Insight)  
- Background: Knight / Devoted (ceremonial order)

Equipment (suggested)
- Longsword, shield, chain mail (or chain shirt per GM), explorer’s pack, oath-token (Silent Throne relic), common clothes, 10 gp

Origins / Home / Job (session-ready)
- Hometown: Caelumbré (near the Grand Basilica) — oath sworn in the city orders.  
- Lodgings / job: Maintains a small lodging near the basilica and performs public rites as duty; sometimes called to officiate at Virelia harvest rites.

Oath & Play Notes (table guidance)
- The oath line "I swear to protect the innocent with my life." is Aldric’s touchstone. Use it to decide whether to act in morally difficult moments, to fuel roleplay scenes, and to bind social obligations.
- Consequences for oath‑breaking (GM decision): ties into the Oath mechanics discussed earlier (Option A/B/C). With Lucky and Variant Human durability, Aldric is mechanically resilient; focus on narrative stakes.
- Public use of Lay on Hands and Divine Sense is visible in Caelumbré and Virelia—consider when to act to avoid Clerisy scrutiny.

Advancement & style tips (near-term)
- L2: Paladin gains spells — discuss with GM which low‑level spells fit Act I constraints (avoid flashy smites in public, prioritize utility and quiet support).
- Use Lucky to hedge important oath tests or to protect allies when the oath compels action.

Player checklist / small TODOs for Jim
- Confirm whether Aldric uses Chain Mail + Shield or Chain Shirt (house rules may affect AC).  
- Pick one or two small background details: mentor in the Basilica, sibling in Virelia, or a named fellow oath-signer.  
- Decide whether to adopt one of the previously suggested oath mechanics (Option A/B/C) or leave it purely narrative (GM confirmation required).

Provenance & status
- This file is noncanonical and staged in /pasture/Characters/ for player review and table use. If you want it promoted to /TTRPG/Characters/ or converted into a Google Doc handout, say so and I will stage/copy and append an audit entry per repository protocol.
