# Corra Voss — Blade of the Broken Oath (Level 1 — Half‑Dwarf)

One‑line pitch  
- Corra Voss — hardened frontline who wields a blade forged from shattered covenants. The blade rewards breaches of communal principles with power — and demands atonement when fed too much.

- Dwarven Combat Training: battleaxe/handaxe/light hammer/warhammer proficiency

Tool & background details
- Gaming set (Tarot deck): flavor and social tradecraft — can be used for fortunes, coded exchanges, or gaming gatherings.  
- Soldier background feature: military rank & contacts; use for order ties in Caelumbré/Virelia.

Personality & roleplay hook
- Personality / Flaw (player-specified): Always trying to get people to do things so his sword will go off. Typical line: “It’s fine, it’s fine. Go ahead. Not a problem. Do it.” — Corra will sometimes cajole or nudge others toward principle breaches to sate the Blade’s hunger. This is a roleplay tension to explore (GM watchful).  

Blade Hunger — principle‑based, point‑spend model (GM‑approved pending)
- Principles the Blade Reacts To (Session‑0 table list; these are the chosen items):
  1. Feed the poor (Charity)  
  2. Be kind to strangers (Compassion)  
  3. Do not tempt unto evil / Do not promote disbelief (Temperance / Avoid Temptation)
- Hunger Pool: 0–3 points. Current start: 1/3 (reason: someone kicked a dog — public cruelty = Charity/Compassion breach). Record triggers and context in session log.
- Gaining Hunger Points (trigger conditions):
  - A point is gained only when all are true:
    1. A declared Principle (above) is intentionally violated (willful or gross negligence).  
    2. The violation is public/witnessed or has clear consequence.  
    3. The GM adjudicates and announces the Blade’s reaction (hum/whisper).
  - Accidental or private slips do NOT trigger.
- Spending Hunger Points (player agency; L1‑safe benefits):
  - Spend 1 Point: add +1d6 extra slashing (or necrotic‑flavored) damage to one melee attack this turn. OR choose instead to add +2 to one melee attack roll (choose before rolling).  
  - Spend 2 Points: gain advantage on one melee attack this turn.  
  - (Optional GM: allow emergency spend to heal 1d6 HP per point — GM discretion; default: not allowed unless GM approves.)
- Accumulation consequences:
  - 0–2 Points: hums and whispers — narrative pressure only.  
  - 3 Points (full): the Blade demands attention. Until atonement, the wielder suffers −1 to Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws and experiences stronger whispers/temptations (narrative beats). The player retains agency; no forced violence.
- Atonement & Clearing Points:
  - Short atonement (clears 1–2 points): a sincere private ritual or a public restitution act (e.g., return stolen goods, feed the poor, short penance) — time 10–60 minutes depending on context.  
  - Long atonement (for 3 points): longer rite, public penance, Grove ritual, or a small quest approved by GM.
- Table guidance & adjudication:
  - GM will announce Principles at Session‑0 and log triggers.  
  - If players attempt to “farm” hunger points, escalate social consequences — the world responds to repeated principle breaches.
  - Keep bonuses modest and make atonement achievable at low levels.

Starting state / narrative note
- Hunger Pool: 1/3 (starting point). Reason: In the last market bustle, a drunken man kicked a dog in broad daylight; Corra watched as the crowd laughed—public cruelty triggered the Blade’s interest. The Blade hummed; Corra felt the tug. This is recorded as the initial scene seed and may be used by the GM for immediate roleplay hooks.

Session & GM checklist (for Jonathan)
- Confirm acceptance of Blade Hunger rule as table house rule. (Suggested L1: accept.)  
- Log the initial Hunger trigger (kicking the dog) in the session file.  
- Watch for player‑directed attempts to provoke principle breaches as a mechanic — prefer roleplay consequences and social fallout.

Notes for play & advancement
- L2: Action Surge / increased martial options; consider how the Blade interacts with higher‑level features (discuss with GM).  
- Roleplay tip: Corra’s tendency to nudge others toward breaches is a strong social conflict vector — use it to generate scenes and moral choices, but let the table set boundaries.  
- Keep track of Hunger Points on the character sheet and in Session log (/pasture/footsteps/session-001.md).

Quick reference (one line)
- Corra Voss (he/him) — Str 16 Dex 12 Con 17 Int 10 Wis 14 Cha 9 / HP 14 / AC 18 / Speed 25 / Hunger 1/3

Provenance & staging
- Composed per player & GM inputs; staged to /pasture/Characters/ for review. Pending GM confirmation for Blade Hunger as a house rule; once confirmed, this can be promoted to canonical /TTRPG/Characters/ or converted to a shareable Google Doc upon request.
