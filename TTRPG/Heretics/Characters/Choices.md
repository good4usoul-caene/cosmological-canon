## ⚠️ Act I Spell Notes (copy into session doc)
- For Act I, avoid casting spells that produce obvious sensory spectacle in public (bright flashes, large elemental effects, dramatic summoning).  
- Allowed: subtle enchantments, social/mental influence spells, quiet divination, and ritual-cast spells with no outward spectacle. The GM rules edge cases.  
- God-Invocation flavor:
  - Pascal’s God: divination returns comforting platitudes (mechanically inert unless GM grants roleplay benefit).  
  - Lucifer/Legion: divinations can be richer but costlier—some require ritual time, an offering, or an emotional/memory exchange. Results may be ironic and tempting; treat mechanical rewards as inspiration or narrative debt rather than flat bonuses.

### 6) 🙏 MAREN VALE — Cleric (Apostate of the Dual Flame)

**Race (suggested):** Human or Half‑Elf

**Features:** Expertise available with level advancement; cunning in smuggling routes and secret doors  
**Hook / Bond:** Smuggles relics and knows hidden paths. Bond: “The Grove keeps me safe if I keep its secrets.”  
**Act I note:** The rogue’s knowledge of the Shimmering Boundary is valuable but risky; selling secrets draws Grove ire.

### 8) ⚖️ ALDRIC VALE — Paladin (Oathbound to the Silent Throne)
**Author / Player:** (TBD)  
**Race (suggested):** Human or Variant  
**Background:** Knight / Devoted

## 🔗 SESSION‑0 SUGGESTIONS & GM NOTES (copy these into the session doc)
- Race & Modifiers: If players select races, apply racial ability modifiers now; don’t spend more than a minute on adjustments for fast session starts.  
- Privacy: Player character files are sensitive — if a player prefers privacy, keep their sheet private and share only with the GM.  
- Spell Safety: Encourage ritual casting and subtle roleplay solutions. If a player wants to cast a flashy spell in a high-risk zone (Caelumbré, Virelia), require a narrative cost or a higher DC.  
- Exposure Tracking: Log every time an erased name is spoken or a relic is used; these exposures escalate arc consequences tied to the Ruined Temple and Shimmering Boundary.  
- Quick Bonds: Use the one-line hooks under each pregen to seed Roleplay and initial quest hooks.  
- Handouts: Copy this single Google Doc and share each player editor access; for in-session safety, set other players to Commenter if they shouldn't edit each other's sheets.

---

## 🔮 ACT I: GOD‑INVOCATION EXAMPLES (for the GM)
- Pascal’s God ("God" / "Pascal"): small divinations are flattened into comforting platitudes. Augury acts like a cantrip-level comfort (flavor text only unless GM grants a bonus).  
- Lucifer / Legion: divinations can be richer but costlier—some require ritual time, an offering, or an emotional/memory exchange. Results may be ironic and tempting; treat mechanical rewards as inspiration or narrative debt rather than flat bonuses.
