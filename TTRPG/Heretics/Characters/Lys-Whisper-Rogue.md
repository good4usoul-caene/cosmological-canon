- **Secret**: Knows the location of the shifting entrance to the Grove of Converging Realms.

Knowledge File Summary
Lys stumbled upon the Grove of Converging Realms while fleeing the Clerisy years ago. The Grove saved their life, and in return, they became its unacknowledged guardian—smuggling relics out of danger, helping fugitives escape, and keeping its location secret. The Clerisy hunts them, but Lys is too clever to be caught. For now.

They don't believe in gods as divine beings—just as powerful entities with their own agendas. But the Grove? The Grove is real, tangible, and worth protecting.

Connections to Party
- **To Corra Voss (Fighter)**: Respects Corra's combat skills; sees potential for profitable partnership.
- **To Elara Keene (Bard)**: Helped Elara escape the city when she was branded a heretic; now traveling together.
- **To Aldra Vey (Wizard NPC)**: Wary of the wizard's scholarly obsession with forbidden names—dangerous knowledge.

Special Ability: Grove-Touched (DM discretion)
Once per long rest, Lys can attempt to locate the nearest boundary of the Grove of Converging Realms (requires concentration and familiarity with the area). The Grove may grant them brief sanctuary or passage if needed.
