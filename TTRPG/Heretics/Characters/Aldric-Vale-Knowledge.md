I am Aldric Vale. I bear an oath I swore in the shadow of the Grand Basilica, and those words shape where I have been raised, where I go, and who I answer to.

— WHERE I'M FROM (Caelumbré: the Basilica City)
- The Basilica sits over the city like a slow sun. I grew up within a few streets of it: the bells, the processions, the ledger-offices. My name was given at an altar, my oath taken in a stone room with other young men and women who thought a promise was a shield as much as a burden.
- Caelumbré is where law and liturgy meet. The Binders’ Quarter keeps the records; clerks and registrars mark things in neat iron hands. If you need to find an official paper, that is where you go. If you want to avoid being noticed, you go nowhere near it on market day.
- I learned ritual posture here: how to stand in procession, how to lower my gaze before the Throne, how to carry a token so it is seen but not read. The city taught me discipline and the thin comfort of ceremony.

— WHERE I GO FOR DUTY (public, expected)
- The Grand Basilica: I am called here often. Public rites, petitions, and small officiations are part of my duty. I read petitions, escort the faithful, and sometimes carry out simple rites of blessing. People look to the Basilica for answers; I give what answers I can.
- Virelia: I travel to Virelia for harvest rites. The villagers bring simple needs—blessings for the crops, seals for house doors. The Field‑Shrine there is small but important: a place where ordinary people ask for ordinary mercy. I am expected to appear, to speak the words, and to keep an eye on the Blade‑of‑Oath rumors that make men nervous during harvest.
- Patrols and civic processions: I walk the roads between wards when called. Sometimes I escort merchant caravans or serve on duty when a civic matter needs a lawful hand. My presence is intended to calm crowds and to show the order's face.

— WHERE I GO FOR SOLITUDE AND COUNSEL (private, reflective)
- A narrow step-lane behind the Basilica: a small courtyard with chipped tiles where I go to practice the words of my oath. It is a place where the city noise softens and I can hear whether the Throne’s silence echoes inside me.
- The Watchmaker’s Hall in Elen’s Watch (occasionally): a place of slow, careful hands. I go there when I need to study an old instrument or ask a quiet question of a scribe who will not shout it in a public ledger. It’s also a good place to be when I wish to avoid clerisy attention—scholars ask questions; they seldom march.
- The infirmary wing near the Basilica: when a private healing is required, or to speak with low-ranked clerics. Lay on Hands is visible; I use it sparingly and in places where the act will not be turned into a spectacle.

— WHERE I GO FOR TROUBLE OR TOMORROW (edges of the order)
- Elen’s Watch (the Promenade): I come here to remember the old temple and to read what the records will allow. The place smells of dust and careful hands. I do not go to the Hidden Copse as a supplicant, but I have walked the outer paths and felt the hush there.
- Thornehold: rarely, and only for necessary things—supply runs, old comrades, or to follow a rumor that will not be safe in the city. It is a rough place that does not care for oaths the way Caelumbré does. If I go, I mark myself: official badge tucked away, and senses sharper.
- Private atonement sites: when I fear my oath has been stained, I go to small chapels, simple stones, or a grove-edge where the order tolerates penance rituals. These are not public; they are acts of repair—time taken, vows renewed, sweat and prayer given back.

— WHO I SEE / CONTACTS (who I know and where they are)
- Archive clerks in the Binders’ Quarter: for permissions, for copies of old petitions, and to see whether a name has been recorded. They sit behind barred desks and like their ink neat.
- Lower Basilica attendants: the ones who sweep altars and keep the ritual candles. They are practical people; they know who came to confession and who left early.
- Watchmaker’s scribes in Elen’s Watch: steady, slow, and sympathetic. They are not clerisy zealots; they keep records for the town, not the Throne.
- Farmers and constables in Virelia: people who know how to pray with two hands and hoe with the other. They will thank you with bread if you protect their harvest.
- A single old sergeant who took my oath with me: I go to him when I need blunt counsel. He will not parade my weakness, but he will name my faults plainly.

— ROUTES I USE (how I move)
- Caelumbré ↔ Virelia: main road; a day's travel, slow and official. Coach lines run here when the bureaucracy requires official papers to be delivered.
- Caelumbré ↔ Elen’s Watch: the older road, slower and quieter. I take it when I want to read the ruins without clerisy patrols taking overhead notice.
- Caelumbré ↔ Thornehold: only when necessary; the passes and the Backgate trade route. Move light and keep a false trail when you can.

— WHAT I AVOID, AND WHY
- Loud miracles in public: the Clerisy notices. A public miracle becomes a spectacle and a question. I prefer private rites unless duty insists.
- Selling or trading relics: my oath forbids profiting from the vulnerable or from sacred things. I will not put a price on a prayer or on a thing that should be hidden.
- Publicly renouncing the order: it is a path that invites trials, scandals, and possibly exile. If I must change my oath, I will do it carefully, with witnesses and with a plan.

— WHAT I CARRY (useful for travel and duty)
- Oath token (worn under the breastplate): a small carved disk that marks me to my order and the Throne. I do not display it for coin.
- A small prayer book, worn at the spine: personal notes and the phrasing of my vow.
- Traveler’s kit and a physician's salve: for small wounds. I will not ignore the needs of others because of ceremony.

— HOW I THINK ABOUT THE GROVE (guarded, conflicted)
- The Grove is not in my order’s books, not publicly. I have heard tales—of trees that sing and of people who will die to protect a sapling. I respect what I do not understand, and I am curious enough to ask questions quietly.
- If the Grove asks me for something that conflicts with my oath, the answer will be hard. For now I keep distance and listen. In time I will test the weight of my promise against what the living world asks of me.

— FINAL NOTE (to self / to comrades)
- I swore to protect the innocent with my life. That is my guiding phrase. It is not a weapon nor a chain—it is a lamp. I hold it up to see where people stand. Where that light leads me, I will go; where it fails, I will carry others until it burns again.
