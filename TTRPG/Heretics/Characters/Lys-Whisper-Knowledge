# Lys Whisper — lining notes (for Ben)

Lys Whisper — notes I keep in the lining of my coat. Things I know, things I’ve seen, and things I’d rather not shout in a market. Use them if you want to walk Thornehold without getting eaten by the clerisy—or sold to the highest bidder.

## — ON THORNEHOLD (what the town is, how it moves)
- The town leans to the road. Backgate Market is the belly: wagons, pack‑goods, and people who can move a thing without asking questions. Best time to work it is dawn (unloading) and dusk (when caravans count coin). Midday the clerisy sends inspectors; they like their lunch hours.  
- Veilstep Alley is the town’s lungs: a tangle of workshops, boiler‑doors, tack‑shops and three inns stacked one above another. Lots of lockable doors, and more false walls than a merchant will admit.  
- The Riven Stage pulls a crowd twice a week. Performances = cover. A cheap tune, a pickpocket pair, and folks who come to forget their taxes. Hara Lin likes performers who bring trouble in small, entertaining bites.  
- Tomas Kree runs the largest inn by the Backgate. He looks like a man who’s seen every road and decided to keep the receipts. He will tell you who paid what—for a price or a favor. He keeps a ledger and a spare key. I have bartered for both.  
- Clerisy presence is patchy: they have lazy days and brutal days. When they’re brutal they sweep the market and check pack‑tags for registry marks. When they’re lazy, they drink at Tomas’s and gossip. Learn which day is which.

## — WHAT THORNEHOLD BUYS / WHAT MOVES WELL
- Small relic fragments, sealed codex pages, dyed threads of chapel cloth, and simple bones that hum when you don’t listen. Pack them in hollowed candles, false tankards, or rolls of leather.  
- Trade prices: small relics fetch coin in Thornehold, better coin in Caelumbré (if you can get them there safely). Keepers of odd things will pay more for provenance—less for rumor. If it hums and you can prove its origin, the price jumps. Proof equals trouble.  
- Market cues: the hawker who sniffs the air and coughs twice is asking if a thing is salted or quiet. Two coughs = “secret buyer present.” If someone slips you a brass bead with a notch, they’re a fence. Learn the notches.

## — ON THE GROVE & THE SHIMMERING BOUNDARY (what it looks/feels like, practical notes)
- The Shimmer is a thin thing: a bend in the air like heat over a stone, like the corner of a dream. It smells of crushed green and old rain. At its edge the light thickens and sounds fold inward. Animals hesitate; your shadow lags.  
- Crossing is not a jump. The boundary tests memory and language—names, songs, and the weight of promises tug at you differently there. Small things remember you differently after you step back out.  
- The Grove does not like being sold. It blesses those who protect it and makes a nuisance of those who trade its blood. Items taken across the boundary sometimes lose their edges or gain new echoes: a knife can hum a name, a coin can grow cold.  
- Approach on foot at night or at dawn. The Shimmer softens at those hours. Don’t light a torch at the edge; glow draws the clerisy’s signal‑lamps from miles.  
- Tokens that help: small carved leaf‑tokens (worn green), a phrase in the old tongue sung low, or a blood‑ink mark placed on a relic (only if you know what you’re doing). If you haven’t been taught a token, don’t improvise one in public.

## — HOW I MOVE THINGS (tradecraft)
- Concealment: hollowed pipe, false lining in a satchel, a child’s toy with a hollow base. Relics inside cloth wrapped in earth smell like market produce. Salt can mask hum for a small time.  
- Transit: I move goods layered across traders’ loads—spices over relics, cloth over spices. Pack‑strong men don’t open sacks where bread sits on top.  
- Exchange ritual: meet at the Riven’s side door, wait for the third bell, hand the thing wrapped in a choir‑scarf. Make sure the buyer leaves coin in the floorboard, not in hand. Hands can be arrested; floorboards can’t.  
- Ledger codes: I write the buyer’s mark in ash on a ledger and a shorthand bead on a string. Never ask them to sign. Signatures mean clerisy paper trails.

## — CONTACTS / PEOPLE I TRUST (and why)
- Tomas Kree (inn proprietor): if he gives you a room it’s safe for a night. He prefers favors to coin—watch his pockets.  
- Hara Lin (Riven Stage manager): you perform or you do the favor. She keeps good ears and worse secrets.  
- “Old Mare” (a fence, name changed in half the whispers): takes relics for city buyers. She pays less but keeps your head out of the gallows.  
- Nialla Ashbough (herbalist in Elen’s Watch): she hates me for my trade but hates worse things more. If a relic is noisy in the wrong way, she can soothe it—if you’re brave enough to ask.

## — WARNINGS (what will kill a deal faster than anything)
- Don’t sell Grove routes to a stranger. A map or a name is a market death sentence. The Grove slips people who do that.  
- Don’t show a relic in front of clerisy banners. They confiscate then burn, and they like public spectacle.  
- Never hand a codex page to someone who uses the phrase “for the good of the faith.” They mean collection, not preservation.  
- If a buyer asks to test a relic by reading it aloud, refuse. If they insist, leave. The test is bait.

## — QUICK SIGNS & LINES (useful in town)
- Signal: three slow knocks on the south inn door = “safe to talk.” Two short coughs under breath = “buyer present.”  
- Line to use when someone presses: “I move things so others may learn.” It’s vague, honorable‑sounding—buys time.  
- Bribe line: show the purse first, then let them see the thing. Let them cling to the coin before they touch the relic.

## — LITTLE TRUTHS I’VE LEARNED (what the Grove taught the trade)
- The Grove keeps time strangely—what you sell it today may be wanted tomorrow. Patience is a currency.  
- A name once remembered is not easily unremembered. Say things quietly. Promise less than you plan to keep.  
- Sometimes keeping a secret is worth more than coin.

If Ben wants to play this, steal the stage, sing a lie, and keep your pockets honest to the Grove when it matters. I’ll show him the door in Veilstep if he agrees to leave the map folded and the child’s pocket empty.
