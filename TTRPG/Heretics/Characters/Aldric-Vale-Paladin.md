One-line pitch
- A paladin bound by oath to Pascal's God, investigating heretical activity—but beginning to question what he's sworn to uphold.

Basics
- Pronouns: he/him  
- Appearance: Tall, armor polished but practical, wears the sigil of Pascal's Gaze on his breastplate. Dark hair, weary eyes, speaks in measured tones.
- Role: Antagonist (initially), potential ally (if PCs engage him thoughtfully)

Ability Scores (simplified for NPC use)
- STR 15, DEX 10, CON 14, INT 10, WIS 12, CHA 14
- AC: 18 (chain mail + shield), HP: 12

Key Abilities
- Divine Sense: Detect celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 ft (3/long rest)
- Lay on Hands: Heal 5 HP total per long rest
- Fighting Style: Defense (+1 AC, already included)
- Spellcasting: None yet (L1 paladin)

Equipment
- Longsword (1d8+2 slashing, versatile 1d10+2)
- Shield
- Chain mail
- Holy symbol of Pascal's God
- Investigation notes on Aldra Vey

Personality & Motivations
- **Ideal**: "The law must be upheld, or society falls into chaos."
- **Bond**: "I swore an oath to protect the faithful and root out heresy."
- **Flaw**: "I sometimes doubt whether my oath serves justice or tyranny."
- **Secret**: Has witnessed the "Silent Throne" in a vision and been shaken by its emptiness.

Background
Aldric Vale swore his oath to Pascal's God as a young man, believing in the promise of eternal paradise and divine justice. He rose through the ranks of the Clerisy's militant arm, investigating heretics and enforcing doctrinal purity.

But recently, something changed. During a prayer vigil, he had a vision of the Silent Throne—the seat of Pascal's God—and found it cold, unmoving, unresponsive. The experience has left him shaken. He still upholds his oath (he must, or lose his powers), but he's beginning to question what he's truly serving.

Now, he's been assigned to investigate Aldra Vey, a scholar accused of heresy. He suspects she's planning something at the Caelumbré market.

Role in the Opening Encounter
- **Hook**: Aldric is watching the market, looking for Aldra or her accomplices.
- **Complication**: If the PCs are helping Aldra (or working the same heist), they'll come into conflict with Aldric.
- **Opportunity**: Aldric is not a fanatic. If the PCs engage him in conversation (rather than combat), they might plant seeds of doubt—or even temporarily ally with him.

GM Guidance
- Aldric should feel like a credible threat but not an unstoppable force. He's a level 1 paladin—competent but beatable.
- He prefers negotiation to violence. He'll try to arrest suspects rather than kill them.
- If the PCs talk to him about the Silent Throne, his oath, or the nature of Pascal's God, he'll listen (though he may not agree).
- He can become a recurring character—sometimes antagonist, sometimes uneasy ally, eventually (possibly) a full defector from the Clerisy.

Tactics
- Aldric fights defensively, using his shield and high AC to protect himself.
- He'll target the most obviously dangerous PC (likely Corra) but will avoid killing blows if possible.
- If reduced to 3 HP or less, he'll retreat to call for reinforcements.

Possible Developments (GM discretion)
- If the PCs spare him or engage him thoughtfully, he may let them escape with a warning.
- He might secretly provide them with information about Clerisy movements.
- His crisis of faith could eventually lead him to join the PCs or break his oath entirely.
