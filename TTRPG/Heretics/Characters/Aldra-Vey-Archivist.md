Personality & Motivations
- **Ideal**: "Knowledge should not be destroyed, even if it's dangerous."
- **Bond**: "The codex I found is the key to understanding what Pascal's God erased."
- **Flaw**: "I'm so absorbed in my research that I underestimate practical dangers."
- **Fear**: Being arrested by the Clerisy before completing her work.

Background
Aldra Vey was a respectable archivist in the city of Caelumbré until she discovered a hidden chamber beneath a collapsed temple. Inside, she found a codex containing divine names that had been systematically erased from all records. Each name, when spoken aloud, seems to resonate with traces of forgotten power.

Now, she's on the run. The Clerisy has branded her a heretic, and a paladin named Aldric Vale is investigating her activities. She needs help—both to stay alive and to complete her research.

Role in the Opening Encounter
- **Hook**: Aldra is attempting to steal (or "recover") a specific divine artifact from the Caelumbré market—one that she believes will help decode the names in her codex.
- **Complication**: Aldric Vale is watching the market, suspecting heretical activity.
- **Player Connection**: The PCs (Corra, Elara, Lys) are either helping Aldra, working the same job independently, or caught in the middle.

GM Guidance
- Aldra should be helpful but not overshadow the PCs. She provides information and context but defers to them for action.
- She's brilliant but impractical—good at theory, bad at combat or stealth.
- If threatened, she'll use Shield or retreat. She won't fight to the death.
- She can become a recurring ally or quest giver, providing leads on other forbidden artifacts or divine mysteries.

Possible Secrets (GM discretion)
- One of the names in her codex is the forgotten god possessing the Barbarian PC.
- Her research is partially funded by a shadowy organization that opposes Pascal's God.
- She's beginning to suspect that speaking the names aloud might have unintended consequences.
