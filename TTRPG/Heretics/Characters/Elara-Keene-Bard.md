Play Notes

- Her forbidden hymn ability (DM discretion) might awaken divine memories or draw unwanted attention.
- She's haunted by the melody she heard in her dream—it guides her decisions.

Knowledge File Summary
Elara grew up in the Choir of the Gaze, singing hymns to Pascal's glory. One night, she dreamed of a different melody—older, sadder, more beautiful. The hymn haunted her until she sang it aloud during practice. The choirmaster heard and branded her a heretic. She fled before the Clerisy could arrest her. Now she wanders, seeking the source of the forbidden song and others who remember what was lost.

Connections to Party
- **To Corra Voss (Fighter)**: Admires Corra's willingness to break oaths; sees her as braver than herself.
- **To Lys Whisper (Rogue)**: Grateful for Lys's help in escaping the city; owes her a favor.
- **To Aldra Vey (Wizard NPC)**: Curious about the forbidden names—wonders if they connect to her hymn.
