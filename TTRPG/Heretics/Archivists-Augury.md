- Easy escape routes through Veilstep Alley if things go wrong

## The Client:  Callisto Danaea 
  - Lys Whisper is hired by him to negotiate a trade with Aldra Vey (Archivist)
  - Callisto wants a complete set of the 13 Zodiac Scrolls, and is willing to trade the Eight Prime Arcana

## The Artifacts: Eight Prime Arcana, 13 Scrolls of the Zodiac
  - **Eight Prime Arcana** Tarot cards with gold filigree:  
    - 2: High Priestess
    - 3: The Emperor
    - 5: The Heirophant
    - 7: The Chariot 
    - 11: Justice (Associated with the Clerisy)
    - 13: Death (Associated with Pascal's Heaven)
    - 17: The Star: Forbidden:  (Sometimes associated with Lucifer; The morning star) 
    - 23: The Tree: (half blooming/half plagued)  
      - Discovered Secret Knowledge by Callisto (Represents Legion)

  - The 13 Houses:
    - Aldra Vey can create one of these as an 8 hour ritual
    - They are scrolls depicting patterns of stars once known as "the Zodiac"
    - All 12 traditional zodiac signs are depicted
    - Forbidden #13: The snake-bearer: Ophiuchus, Moses, Tiresias, Nicodemus

  ## Corra's role (PC - Jeremy)
    - Corra is working as a lookout for the Archivist (Aldra Vey) and the Bard (Elara Keene)
    - His job is to give a warning when Clerisy is around
    - Position: Watching the street entrance and monitoring crowd behavior
    - Knowledge: Corra knows Thornehold from militia work and can read when clerisy inspectors are doing "brutal days" vs "lazy days"

  ## Aldra's role (NPC - Wizard/Diviner)
    - Subtle enchantments, bringing in clients for fortune-telling
    - Subtle enchantments, "nothing-to-see-here" for non-clients and clerisy
    - Apparent role: busker, playing for tips
    - Location: Set up near the Riven Stage side entrance (Hara Lin has given permission)

  ## Elara's role (PC or NPC - Bard)
    - Maintains constant ritual augury with Legion
    - Offers fortune-telling to clients Legion deems worthy
    - Provides musical cover for the operation (performances are expected at the Riven Stage)
    - Uses her forbidden hymn knowledge to enhance divinations

  ## Lys Whisper's role (PC - Ben)
    - Arrives with Eight Prime Arcana to negotiate a trade for the 13 Zodiac Scrolls
    - This is their home territory (Thornehold) - they know escape routes, contacts, and hiding spots
    - Has access to Veilstep Alley's back doors and false walls if quick escape is needed
    - Knows Tomas Kree and Hara Lin (contacts who can provide cover or warnings)

  ## Aldric Vale's role (PC - Jim)
    - Arrives with two clerisy inquisitors to investigate Elara for suspicions of forbidden glyphs
    - On patrol from Caelumbré, following reports of heretical activity in Thornehold
    - His oath compels him to act, but his doubts about the Silent Throne create internal conflict

  ## Likely result.  
    - Lys Whisper is in the middle of trade negotiations with Aldra, (All artifacts are layed out and being discussed)
    - Aldric Vale and Clerisy inquisitors arrive finding all the evidence laid out.
    - Clerisy inquisitors attempt to arrest Lys and Elara, or rattle summoning beads if Elara and Corra get involved.
    - Results of Aldra's continuing augury manifest as Modron's standing in Aldric's way...  Blocking his way.  He must choose to engage each monodrone, (kill it) by accepting the augural principle, or to dismiss each monodrone by rejecting the augural principle.  This will delay him for three rounds.  

## 🔮 Augural Principles

1. **"Proof of a Crime may mean Proof of a Concept"**

2. **"Faith must have Hope"**

3. **Without Branches, a tree cannot grow or take root**

These will serve as Aldric Vale's rationale for breaking his oath to Pascal's God.

Doubt may summon Modrons.

## ⚙️ Monodrone Stat Block (CR 1/8)

*Small construct, lawful neutral*

**Armor Class** 15 (natural armor)  
**Hit Points** 5 (1d6 + 2)  
**Speed** 30 ft., fly 30 ft.

**STR** 10 (+0) | **DEX** 13 (+1) | **CON** 12 (+1)  
**INT** 4 (-3) | **WIS** 10 (+0) | **CHA** 5 (-3)

**Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 10  
**Languages** Modron  
**Challenge** 1/8 (25 XP)

**Axiomatic Mind.** The monodrone can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

**Disintegration.** If the monodrone dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind its weapons and anything else it was carrying.

**Actions**

***Dagger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage.

***Javelin.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.

**Augural Manifestation (Special)**

These monodrones are manifested by Aldra's augury ritual in response to Aldric's doubt. Each one represents one of the three Augural Principles:

- **Monodrone 1** embodies "Proof of a Crime may mean Proof of a Concept"
- **Monodrone 2** embodies "Faith must have Hope"  
- **Monodrone 3** embodies "Without Branches, a tree cannot grow or take root"

Each monodrone blocks Aldric's path. To dismiss a monodrone, Aldric must either:
- **Accept the principle** it represents (speak acknowledgment, takes 1 action) — monodrone fades peacefully
- **Reject the principle** and destroy the monodrone through combat (standard combat)

Each interaction (acceptance or combat) takes approximately one round, delaying Aldric for three rounds total while the other PCs can act.

## 🎭 Encounter Flow

### Setup Phase
- **Location**: Near the Riven Stage side entrance, Thornehold
- **Cover Story**: Aldra is busking as a fortune-teller; Elara provides musical accompaniment
- **Crowd**: Moderate evening crowd provides cover but also witnesses
- **Lookout**: Corra positioned to watch for clerisy patrols

### Phase 1: The Negotiation (5-10 minutes)
- Lys arrives with the Eight Prime Arcana (concealed in their satchel with hidden compartments)
- Aldra and Lys begin examining the artifacts while Elara maintains augury with Legion
- All artifacts are laid out on the reading table (tarot cards and zodiac scrolls)
- This is the critical moment of vulnerability — evidence is visible

### Phase 2: The Arrival (when tension is highest)
- Aldric Vale arrives with two clerisy inquisitors
- They've been following reports of forbidden divination in Thornehold
- Aldric recognizes the forbidden artifacts immediately (Justice card, The Star card, zodiac imagery)
- The inquisitors move to arrest Lys and Elara

### Phase 3: The Augural Response (3 rounds)
- As Aldric moves to intervene, Aldra's continuing augury manifests
- Three Monodrones materialize, each blocking Aldric's path in sequence
- Aldric must choose for each one: accept the principle or fight the modron
- Each choice takes one round, giving other PCs time to act

**PC Options During This Phase:**
- **Corra**: Engage the clerisy inquisitors, protect Lys/Elara, or help Aldric
- **Lys**: Grab the artifacts and flee through Veilstep Alley (they know the escape routes)
- **Elara**: Continue the augury, use social magic, or retreat
- **Aldric**: Must deal with each modron (accept or fight), then choose whether to arrest or let the heretics go

### Phase 4: Resolution
Multiple possible outcomes based on PC choices and Aldric's decisions.

## ⚔️ Clerisy Inquisitor Stat Block (CR 1/2)

*Medium humanoid, lawful neutral*

**Armor Class** 13 (leather armor)  
**Hit Points** 16 (3d8 + 3)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

**STR** 11 (+0) | **DEX** 14 (+2) | **CON** 12 (+1)  
**INT** 10 (+0) | **WIS** 13 (+1) | **CHA** 11 (+0)

**Actions**

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

**Tactics**
- Inquisitors prioritize arrest over killing

- They focus on restraining spell casters first (Aldra, Elara)
- Not fanatics — will retreat if outmatched or if Aldric orders them to stand down

## 📍 Location Details: Thornehold Specifics

**The Riven Stage** (from Lys's knowledge):
- Pulls a crowd twice a week for performances
- Managed by Hara Lin (contact who tolerates interesting trouble)
- Side door provides quick access to Veilstep Alley

**Escape Routes** (if needed):
- Veilstep Alley: tangle of workshops with lockable doors and false walls
- Tomas Kree's inn: three buildings stacked, multiple exits
- Back through market stalls toward the Backgate (if heading out of town)

**Clerisy Presence**:
- Patchy in Thornehold (unlike Caelumbré)
- Having "brutal days" when they sweep the market aggressively
- Tonight is a medium-threat evening (not a full sweep, but patrols are active)

## 📝 Notes

This scenario incorporates:
- **Lys's Thornehold knowledge**: Home territory advantage, escape routes, contacts (Hara Lin, Tomas Kree)
- **Corra's militia experience**: Ability to read clerisy patterns and provide effective lookout
- **Aldric's internal conflict**: The Silent Throne doubts manifesting through the augural principles
- **Character-driven tension**: Each PC has meaningful choices that affect the outcome

Augural wisdom for those who archive forbidden knowledge and practice heretical scholarship.
