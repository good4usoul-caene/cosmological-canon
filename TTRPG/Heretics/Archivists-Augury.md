## The Client:  Callisto Danaea 
  - Lys Whisper is hired by him to negotiate a trade with Aldra Vey (Archivist)
  - Callisto wants a complete set of the 13 Zodiac Scrolls, and is willing to trade the Seven Prime Arcana

## The Artifacts: Eight Prime Arcana, 13 Scrolls of the Zodiac
  - **Seven Prime Arcana** Tarot cards with gold filigree:  
    - 2: High Priestess
    - 3: The Emperor
    - 5: The Heirophant
    - 7: The Chariot 
    - 11: Justice (Associated with the Clerisy)
    - 13: Death (Associated with Pascal's Heaven)
    - 17: The Star: Forbidden:  (Sometimes associated with Lucifer; The morning star) 
    - 23: The Tree: (half blooming/half plagued)  
      - Discovered Secret Knowledge by Callisto (Represents Legion)

  - The 13 Houses:
    - Aldra Vey can create one of these as an 8 hour ritual
    - They are scrolls depicting patterns of stars once known as "the Zodiac"
    - All 12 traditional zodiac signs are depicted
    - Forbidden #13: The snake-bearer: Ophiuchus, Moses, Tiresias, Nicodemus

  ## Corra's role (PC - Jeremy)
    - Corra is working as a lookout for the NPD: Archivist (Aldra Vey) and the Bard (Elara Keene).  
    - His business is to give a warning when Clerisy is around

  ## Aldra's role (NPC - Wizard/Diviner)
    - Subtle enchantments, bringing in clients for fortune-telling
    - Subtle enchantments, "nothing-to-see-here" for non-clients, and clerisy.
    - Apparent role: busker.  Playing for tips

  ## Elara's role (NPC - Bard)
    - Maintains constant ritual augury with Legion
    - Offers fortune-telling to clients Legion deems worthy

  ## Lys Whisper's role (PC - Ben)
    - Arrives with Eight Prime Arcana, to negotiate a trade for the 13 Zodiac

  ## Aldric Vale's role (PC - Jim)
    - Arrives with two clerisy inquisitors to investigate Elara, for suspicions of forbidden glyphs

  ## Likely result.  
    - Lys Whisper is in the middle of trade negotiations with Aldra, (All artifacts are layed out and being discussed)
    - Aldric Vale and Clerisy inquisitors arrive finding all the evidence laid out.
    - Clerisy inquisitors attempt to arrest Lys and Elara, or rattle summoning beads if Elara and Corra get involved.
    - Results of Aldra's continuing augury manifest as Modron's standing in Aldric's way...  Blocking his way.  He must choose to engage each monodrone, (kill it) by accepting the augural principle, or to dismiss each monodrone by rejecting the augural principle.  This will delay him for three rounds.  

## 🔮 Augural Principles

1. **"Proof of a Crime may mean Proof of a Concept"**

2. **"Faith must have Hope"**

3. **Without Branches, a tree cannot grow or take root**

These will serve as Aldric Vale's rationale for breaking his oath to Pascal's God.

Doubt may summon Modrons.
