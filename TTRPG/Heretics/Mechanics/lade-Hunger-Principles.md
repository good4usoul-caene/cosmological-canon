Author: Organizationel – Chroniclekeeper (proposal)
Proposed-By: Jonathan Doolin (GM suggestion captured)
Date: 2025-11-01
Genre: Mechanics Proposal / Narrative Hook
RitualNote: Refines the “Blade Hunger” concept so the weapon reacts to violation of communal moral principles (publicly obvious breaches), and uses expendable points as the activation resource. Designed to be narrative-first and L1-safe; GM must confirm final numbers.
Change-Note: New proposal implements principle‑based triggers and a point‑spend activation model; includes guidance for adjudication, examples, atonement, and balance.

Summary
-------
Instead of reacting to players breaking private personal oaths, the Blade of Broken Oath (“the Blade”) delights in the breaking of certain public, communal principles—broad moral maxims the community holds (examples: “Feed the poor,” “Lead us not into temptation,” “Be kind to strangers”). When a principle is knowingly violated in scene (clear, witnessed, and consequential), the Blade accrues Hunger Points. The wielder may spend Hunger Points to fuel modest combat benefits. Marks that accumulate without atonement create narrative and minor mechanical pressure.

Design goals
- Keep late‑night “people break private promises” awkwardness out of play.  
- Tie the Blade’s hunger to visible, socially meaningful acts (principles), not private flubs.  
- Let the player spend points for clear, small mechanical benefits (player agency).  
- Preserve roleplay: the blade’s voice and temptations are story hooks, not railroads.  
- L1-safe: bonuses are small and recovery/atonement is possible through roleplay or modest ritual.

Principles (examples)
- Charity: “Feed the poor” — giving, sharing, tending those in need.  
- Temperance / Humility: “Lead us not into temptation” — avoid needless excess, cruelty, or scandal.  
- Compassion / Kindness: “Be kind to strangers” — mercy, hospitality, restraint.  
- Truth / Honor: “Tell the truth in court” — honesty in civic/legal contexts.  
- Hospitality: “Offer shelter to the weary” — refusing sanctuary in a moment of need is a principle breach.  
- Vigilance / Duty: “Stand your post” — abandoning a charge in a crisis.  

(Use a short GM list of 3–6 principles relevant to the setting; announce them in Session‑0 so players know the social values the Blade responds to.)

Triggering a Hunger Point
- A Hunger Point is gained only when all these conditions are met:
  1. The action clearly violates one of the declared community Principles (above).  
  2. The violation is intentional or grossly negligent (accidents do not count).  
  3. The violation is witnessed or has a public consequence (a private slip in a locked room doesn’t trigger).  
  4. The GM adjudicates the trigger and announces the Blade’s reaction (hum, chill, whisper).
- Example triggers:
  - Corra sells allocated soup intended for a Virelia relief queue to the highest bidder (Charity violated) → +1 Hunger Point.  
  - Corra publicly abandons his militia post during a civic procession to chase personal revenge (Vigilance violated) → +1 Hunger Point.  
  - Corra lies in a court hearing to ruin a neighbor (Truth violated) → +1 Hunger Point.

Gaining vs. Spending
- Hunger Pool: the Blade stores up to 3 Hunger Points.
- Spending: the wielder may spend Hunger Points as an immediate resource in combat or a dramatic scene. Suggested, L1‑safe spends:
  - Spend 1 Point: add +1d6 extra slashing (or necrotic‑flavored) damage to one melee attack this turn.  
  - Spend 1 Point: grant +2 to one attack roll instead of the damage (player chooses before roll).  
  - Spend 2 Points: gain advantage on one melee attack this turn (stronger but costs more).  
  - (Optional: allow one‑time emergency spend to heal 1d6 HP per point — GM discretion.)
- Points are consumed when spent.

Consequences of Accumulation
- 0–2 Points: the Blade hums softly; roleplay whispers, temptation nudges appear. No mechanical compulsion.  
- 3 Points (full): the Blade demands attention. Until atonement (see below), the wielder suffers a minor mechanical and narrative friction:
  - Mechanical: −1 to Charisma checks and saving throws (represents moral tension and tempest in the soul).  
  - Narrative: the Blade whispers a directive; scenes include temptations and increased scrutiny (NPCs notice the blade’s behavior).  
  - The player always retains agency; the blade will not force violent acts mechanically — instead the GM uses persuasion/temptation beats and high‑stakes roleplay opportunities.  
- The Blade may tempt the wielder with shortcuts and bargains to gain feedings—use these as story beats, not telegraphed mechanical traps.

Atonement & Clearing Hunger Points
- Short Atonement (clears all Points if 1–2): a private ritual (10–60 minutes), a sincere public act of restitution (return money, feed the poor, etc.), or a meaningful service to the harmed party. Cost: time and a symbolic offering (coin, oath token, or small sacrifice). Requires roleplay; NPCs may help expedite if owed favors exist.
- Long Atonement (for 3 Points): a longer rite (hours, a small quest, or a Grove ritual), public penance, or a story beat approved by the GM. Institute a small narrative cost (task, service) rather than permanent punishing mechanics.

Edge cases & adjudication guidance for the GM
- Grey actions: If an action is ambiguous, require either a player admission or an obvious real consequence (injury, public knowledge) to trigger. Prefer discussion over gaveling.  
- Accidental harm: accidents do not trigger. The Blade responds to willful or grossly negligent denials of principle.  
- Strategic plays: If the party opts to intentionally provoke the Blade to gain points (e.g., agree to break a Principle to farm power), the GM should treat it as a valid choice but escalate consequences and social fallout—do not stop player agency, but make costs visible.  
- Logging: track Hunger Points on the character sheet and note trigger/context in the session log for future story hooks.

Flavor & Roleplay
- First feed: the Blade hums and whispers a short phrase relevant to the principle (e.g., after a Charity breach: “Hunger is answered; hunger returns.”)  
- Second feed: the whispers coalesce into temptation (“Give one more and the hunger will be sated.”)  
- Full feed: the blade’s whisper is a voice: suggestive, knowledgeable, hungry — use it to pull the character into scenes where atonement is possible.

Why this fits Jonathan’s concern
- The sword no longer rewards private, trivial oath‑breaking. It responds to breaches of shared social morals — actions that are meaningful and rare enough to be dramatic.  
- The spending model gives players agency and predictable short‑term benefits while making long‑term reckoning an on‑table story.

Balance notes (GM)
- L1 safety: keep immediate spends modest (+1d6 or +2 to hit) so combats remain low‑level appropriate.  
- Atonement should be achievable without needing a high‑level solution; prefer time/service/rituals within reach of low‑level parties.  
- If the party experiments with feeding the Blade tactically, be ready to escalate social/political consequences (loss of trust, public trials, Grove reaction).

Suggested table phrasing for player & GM
- GM announces Principles at Session 0 and records them on the shared doc.  
- When the GM deems a trigger met, announce: “Blade gains 1 Hunger Point (Principle: Charity). Corra hears a soft hum at his shoulder.”  
- When the player spends: “I spend 1 Hunger Point to add +1d6 to my longsword strike.” The point is then removed and the effect resolved.

Sample entry to add to Corra’s character sheet
- Blade Hunger (Principle‑Based): Hunger Pool 0/3. Triggers when a declared Principle is intentionally violated in public. Spend 1 → +1d6 damage OR +2 to an attack. At 3 marks: −1 Cha checks & saves until atonement. Atonement clears points (short ritual or restitution for 1–2 points; longer rite or quest for 3 points).

Closing notes
-------------
If this captures the intended direction, pick one of the spend‑effects (or tweak numbers) and I’ll generate an updated Corra Voss sheet that includes this Blade Hunger rule text, a short log entry template for triggers, and a Session‑0 note to present to GM Jonathan for final approval.

If you want tighter or looser mechanical power, say so (e.g., change +1d6 → +1d4 for gentler boost, or allow 1 point → advantage instead of damage).
