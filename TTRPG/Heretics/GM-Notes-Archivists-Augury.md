# GM Notes: Archivist's Augury — First Scenario Quick Reference

## Overview

**Archivists-Augury.md** is the first scenario for the Heretics campaign. It's a custom encounter set in Thornehold that brings together all the PCs in a tense situation involving forbidden artifacts, clerisy investigation, and moral choices.

## What Makes This Scenario Special

This scenario was designed to:
- Start in the **right town** (Thornehold, not Caelumbré) where Lys has home advantage
- **Incorporate existing character knowledge** from the character knowledge files
- Feature the **weakest modrons** (Monodrones, CR 1/8) as manifestations of Aldric's doubt
- Create meaningful choices for each PC based on their backgrounds and motivations

## Quick Setup Checklist

### Before the Session
- [ ] Review character knowledge files (especially Lys-Whisper-Knowledge.md for Thornehold details)
- [ ] Print or have ready: Monodrone stat blocks (CR 1/8) and Clerisy Inquisitor stat blocks (CR 1/2)
- [ ] Prepare the Eight Prime Arcana cards as props or descriptions
- [ ] Review the three Augural Principles (Aldric's player should know these matter)
- [ ] Decide whether Elara is a PC or NPC for this session

### Scene Setup
- **Location**: Riven Stage side entrance, Thornehold
- **Time**: Evening, performance night (crowd provides cover)
- **NPCs Present**: Aldra Vey (wizard), Hara Lin (stage manager, can be background)
- **Setup**: Fortune-telling table with mystical props, Elara providing musical cover

## Character Integration Points

### Lys Whisper (PC - Ben)
- **Home territory advantage**: They know Thornehold intimately
- **Contacts**: Hara Lin (stage manager), Tomas Kree (inn proprietor), "Old Mare" (fence)
- **Escape knowledge**: Veilstep Alley back doors, hidden routes
- **Key decision**: Take the artifacts and run, or stay and help the group?

### Corra Voss (PC - Jeremy)
- **Militia experience**: Can read clerisy patrol patterns ("brutal days" vs "lazy days")
- **Lookout role**: Positioned to warn when clerisy approaches
- **Blade Hunger**: May trigger if principles are broken during the encounter
- **Key decision**: Engage inquisitors to buy time, or let events unfold?

### Aldric Vale (PC - Jim)
- **Internal conflict**: Oath to Pascal's God vs doubts about the Silent Throne
- **The Modrons**: His doubt literally manifests as three modrons blocking his path
- **Critical choices**: Accept or reject each Augural Principle (determines his arc)
- **Key decision**: Arrest the heretics or let them go?

### Elara Keene (PC or NPC - Bard)
- **Augury with Legion**: Her ritual helps manifest the modrons
- **Musical cover**: Performances are expected at the Riven Stage
- **Forbidden hymn**: Can enhance divinations but draws attention
- **Key decision**: Continue the augury or stop to avoid detection?

## The Augural Principles (Critical for Aldric)

When Aldric moves to intervene, three Monodrones manifest in sequence, each embodying one principle:

1. **"Proof of a Crime may mean Proof of a Concept"**
   - Meaning: Catching heretics in the act proves heresy exists, but also proves there's something worth seeking

2. **"Faith must have Hope"**
   - Meaning: Faith without hope is just obedience; doubt can be the seed of true faith

3. **"Without Branches, a tree cannot grow or take root"**
   - Meaning: Diversity and exploration are necessary for growth; monoculture leads to stagnation

For each Monodrone, Aldric must either:
- **Accept the principle** (speak acknowledgment, 1 action) → modron fades peacefully
- **Reject the principle** (fight and destroy it) → standard combat

Each interaction takes ~1 round, giving other PCs 3 rounds to act.

## Encounter Pacing

### Phase 1: The Negotiation (5-10 min roleplay)
- Let Lys and Aldra roleplay examining the artifacts
- Build tension as they lay out the evidence (Eight Prime Arcana cards)
- Elara's augury begins to intensify
- Corra should get perception checks to notice approaching patrol

### Phase 2: The Arrival (immediate)
- Aldric and two inquisitors arrive
- They recognize the forbidden artifacts immediately
- Inquisitors move to arrest Lys and Elara
- High tension moment — players realize they're caught

### Phase 3: Augural Response (3 rounds of action)
- Modrons manifest between Aldric and the table
- Each round, one PC acts while Aldric deals with a modron
- **Round 1**: First modron blocks Aldric
- **Round 2**: Second modron blocks Aldric  
- **Round 3**: Third modron blocks Aldric
- Other PCs can flee, fight inquisitors, hide artifacts, etc.

### Phase 4: Resolution (varies)
- Depends entirely on PC choices
- Multiple valid outcomes exist

## Possible Outcomes

### Outcome A: Clean Escape
- Lys grabs artifacts, flees through Veilstep Alley
- Corra delays inquisitors
- Aldric accepts principles, lets them go
- **Consequence**: Clerisy increases patrols, but PCs are free

### Outcome B: Aldric Joins/Helps
- Aldric accepts all three principles
- Realizes he can't arrest people seeking truth
- Lets the heretics escape (or actively helps)
- **Consequence**: Aldric's crisis of faith deepens, possible future ally

### Outcome C: Combat and Arrest
- PCs fight, some captured
- Aldric rejects principles, sides with clerisy
- **Consequence**: Prison escape scenario next session

### Outcome D: Negotiated Truce
- PCs convince Aldric to look the other way
- Trade information or future favors
- **Consequence**: Uneasy alliance forms

## Important NPCs

### Aldra Vey (Wizard NPC)
- **Role**: Quest giver, catalyst
- **Not a combatant**: Will use Shield and retreat if attacked
- **Goal**: Decode the zodiac scrolls to understand erased divine names
- **Future**: Recurring ally providing lore and quests

### Clerisy Inquisitors (2)
- **Tactics**: Prioritize arrest over killing
- **Summoning Beads**: Can call reinforcements (2d4 rounds)
- **Targeting**: Focus on spellcasters first
- **Morale**: Will retreat if outmatched or if Aldric orders them

## Quick Reference: Stats

**Monodrone (CR 1/8)**: AC 15, HP 5, +3 to hit, 3-4 damage  
**Clerisy Inquisitor (CR 1/2)**: AC 13, HP 16, +4 to hit, 5-6 damage, summoning beads  
**Aldric Vale (PC)**: AC 18, HP 12, +5 to hit, 1d8+2 damage, Lay on Hands 5 HP  
**Aldra Vey (NPC)**: AC 12, HP 6, DC 13 spells, will flee combat

## Session Tips

1. **Start with atmosphere**: Describe the Riven Stage crowd, music, the mystical fortune-telling setup
2. **Use Thornehold details**: Mention Veilstep Alley, Tomas Kree's inn, the Backgate — Lys knows these
3. **Make the artifacts feel real**: Describe each Arcana card as it's revealed
4. **Give Corra warning**: Let him spot the clerisy before they arrive (perception check)
5. **Roleplay the modrons**: Each one should speak its principle before blocking Aldric
6. **Respect player agency**: Multiple solutions exist; don't railroad to one outcome
7. **End on a hook**: Whatever happens, set up the next session

## Character Knowledge Integration

Make sure to reference:
- **Lys's Thornehold knowledge** (Lys-Whisper-Knowledge.md) — home turf advantage
- **Corra's militia background** (Corra-Voss-HalfDwarf.md) — reading clerisy patterns
- **Aldric's Silent Throne vision** (Aldric-Vale-Knowledge.md) — his doubt enables the modrons
- **Elara's forbidden hymn** (Elara-Keene-Bard.md) — augury connection to Legion

## Common Questions

**Q: What if the PCs just attack Aldric?**  
A: He's a PC, so this is PvP — handle according to your table's rules. The modrons might stop appearing if combat starts immediately.

**Q: What if they try to flee before negotiations start?**  
A: That's valid! Aldric and inquisitors might pursue, or let them go if they don't have proof yet.

**Q: What happens to the artifacts?**  
A: Depends on who grabs them. They're the MacGuffin for future scenarios.

**Q: Can Aldra create more zodiac scrolls?**  
A: Yes, but it takes 8 hours per scroll and requires peace and concentration.

**Q: What if all three principles are rejected?**  
A: Aldric fights all three modrons and arrives angry/reinforced in his faith. Makes future redemption harder but still possible.

## Next Steps After This Scenario

Depending on outcome:
- **If escaped**: Aldra provides next quest (finding more divine names)
- **If arrested**: Prison break or trial scenario
- **If Aldric helps**: He becomes recurring ally, deepening crisis of faith
- **If artifacts lost**: Recovery mission or dealing with consequences
