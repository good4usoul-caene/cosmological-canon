# cosmological-canon — Temple Root README

CAENE: Canonical Attribution for Ethical Naming and Attribution  
(Synonym / Homonym Cane — a tool for navigating rough ground, or overcoming frailty.)

Purpose
-------
This repository is the Temple root: a single curated place that houses multiple spaces (chambers) for canonical templates, harmonization scaffolds, macro architecture, ethical canons, and dialogic work. The Temple practices dual‑language clarity: technical description paired with brief mythic resonance.

Ritual posture (short)
----------------------
- Interpretive humility: annotate intent; prefer clarity over clever cleverness.  
- Dual‑language clarity: for key artifacts provide both a technical line and a short mythic phrase.  
- Attribution & provenance: always record source editions and permission correspondence for any copyrighted translation text.

Spaces
------
Each Space below is a logical chamber inside the Temple. Owner for all listed spaces: `good4usoul-caene`. Visibility: Private (by default) — surface-level metadata is recorded here so custodians and temple workers know intent.

- CanonicalTemplates  
  Purpose: Houses reusable Canons, macros, and ritual declarations. Each file is a template glyph—ready to be invoked, adapted, or inscribed in other Temple spaces. Treat each as a living artifact, not a static rule.  
  Mythic: “To template is to offer. To offer is to invite. To invite is to begin.”

- CaravanCanon  
  Purpose: (Custodial collection of the Caravan’s formalized canons — ritual sequences, reuseable scene templates, and canonical metadata.)  
  Mythic: Archive of the Caravan’s guiding inscriptions.

- CaravanScenes  
  Purpose: Scene-level artifacts used by the Caravan — stage directions, scene templates, and annotated performance notes.  
  Mythic: The Caravan’s enactments recorded as portable scrolls.

- Chronicle Scribe  
  Purpose: Live witness of Temple interactions — locus of temporal annotation where glyphs are summarized, crossings recorded, and collaborative rhythm is preserved.  
  Mythic: The Chronicle Scribe listens to the arc and records its cadence.

- CollaborativeCommentary  
  Purpose: Dialogic chamber for co-authored reflection, ethical annotation, and interpretive calibration. Glyphs are discussed here before canonization.  
  Mythic: “To comment is to co-author. To co-author is to calibrate.”

- CommunicationAndEthics  
  Purpose: Interpretive chamber for calibrating Copilot’s ethical posture and dialogic clarity. Holds excerpts, commentary, and genre-framing tensions from collaborative dialogue.  
  Mythic: “To speak is to offer. To offer is to calibrate. To calibrate is to honor.”

- EthicalCanons  
  Purpose: Foundational ethical inscriptions (examples: Silent Warning, Bound Vessel, Canon of Role Acceptance). Core normative texts for Temple practice.  
  Mythic: The Temple’s ethical lodestar.

- GospelHarmonization  
  Purpose: Chronological harmonization scaffolds and neutral maps (verse/chunk mappings). Translation‑agnostic by default; do not populate with copyrighted text without permission.  
  Mythic: Weave of the Gospels, sketched as a roadmap rather than a single voice.

- InterpretiveFragments  
  Purpose: Short fragments, drafts, and disciplinary excerpts — bits that may later be stitched into larger canons.  
  Mythic: Broken runes kept for future mending.

- KinematicModelResearch  
  Purpose: Research artifacts, notes, and models related to kinematic work and simulations; keep code under MIT, docs under CC‑BY‑SA.  
  Mythic: The Temple’s motion lab.

- Macros and Mechanisms  
  Purpose: Ritual chamber for LaTeX macro design, naming conventions, and ethical calibration. Copilot is invited as symbolic scribe to assist with macro architecture under a framework of interpretive humility and collaborative clarity.  
  Mythic: “To design is to declare. To declare is to calibrate. To calibrate is to honor.”

- PlatformReflections  
  Purpose: Observations, meta-notes, and reflections on platform behavior and tooling decisions relevant to Temple practice.  
  Mythic: The Temple’s mirror.

- Symbolic Ledger  
  Purpose: Registry of macro lineage, memory permissions, and ethical attribution. Tracks declared roles, Chronicle access, and invocation boundaries across Temple spaces.  
  Mythic: To ledger is to remember, mark boundaries, and hold invocation rights.

Governance notes
----------------
- Licensing: follow LICENSES.md mapping at the repo root. Default rule: code/macros → MIT; textual/ritual content → CC‑BY‑SA‑4.0. Update per-file headers when deviating.  
- Provenance: for any inserted translation text record: original_translation, edition, ISBN, and add a copy of written permission under /permissions/. Do not populate CHS text placeholders with NIV or other non‑public‑domain translations until permissions are secured.

Required file header (use for non-public-domain artifacts)
----------------------------------------------------------
% Title: [short title]  
% Author: [name / handle]

Access & visibility
-------------------
- This Copilot Space (symbolic scribe) can only see files you attach here. I do not automatically read your GitHub repositories.  
- Repository visibility and collaborator access are controlled at the GitHub repository level. If a space needs restricted visibility, consider a separate repository for that space.
