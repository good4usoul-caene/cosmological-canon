cosmological-canons — Purpose & quick orientation

Purpose / Ritual intent
-----------------------
A repository-shaped Tabula Rasa for the Chronological Harmonization Space (CHS).
This root README gives immediate orientation for collaborators and attendants.

Technical summary
-----------------
- Workspace short-name: CHS (use this shorthand in commit messages and tasks)
- Primary content folder: cosmologicalcanon/
- Translation-agnostic scaffold files live at the repo root as chron-scaffold.*
- Licensing: macros/code → MIT; canonical text/scaffolds/docs → CC-BY-SA-4.0

Mythic / interpretive note
--------------------------
Treat this folder as the temple courtyard — empty but consecrated. Inscribe slowly, annotate provenance, and preserve interpretive lineage.

Quick links (paths inside this repo)
-----------------------------------
- (MAM) CHS — Attendant Brief.md      — canonical brief for attendants (place at repo root)
- chron-scaffold.csv / .json          — translation-agnostic chronological scaffold (leave text placeholders empty until permission)
- cosmologicalcanon/                  — macros, seeded-glyphs, docs
- LICENSE (MIT)                       — for code/macros
- LICENSE-CC-BY-SA-4.0 (summary)      — for canonical text & scaffolds
- LICENSES.md                         — mapping of which file/folder is under which license
- permission-notice/                  — place permission correspondence here when received

Immediate instruction to attendants
-----------------------------------
1) Do not populate chron-scaffold.* text fields with non-public-domain translation text until a permission file is stored under /permission-notice.  
2) Add per-file provenance headers when inserting translation text.  
3) Keep replies to the author concise and include the passage_ids you handled.

If you need a suggested next action, say which single file you'd like me to create or populate first (LICENSES.md, chron-scaffold.csv, brief already shown, or an empty cosmologicalcanon/macros/standard-macros.tex).
