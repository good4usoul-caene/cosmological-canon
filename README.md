# 🏛️ Cosmological Canon - Temple Repository

**A sacred workspace for theological exploration, AI collaboration, and knowledge curation**

This Temple serves as a structured repository for biblical scholarship, TTRPG campaigns, automation workflows, and human-AI collaborative research within a framework of interpretive humility and proper attribution.

## 📋 Repository Overview

The cosmological-canon represents a comprehensive knowledge management system with:
- **Biblical analysis** in GospelHarmonization spaces (Leading/Heuristic Hypotheses, Epistemic Commentary)
- **TTRPG campaign materials** for the Heretics setting
- **AI collaboration protocols** and persona calibration frameworks  
- **Automated promotion workflows** from echo-space to canonical repository
- **Governance policies** ensuring proper attribution and quality control

## 🎯 Getting Started

**For Newcomers:**
1. Start with the `/README.md` (you're here!) to understand the Temple's purpose
2. Review `/policies/spirits.md` for the governance framework and role definitions
3. Explore `/spaces/` for active content areas, beginning with `/spaces/GospelHarmonization/`
4. Check `/methods/` for detailed workflow documentation
5. See `/policies_def-access.md` for access levels and contribution guidelines

**For Contributors:**
- All contributions must include proper Temple front-matter headers
- Follow the echo → foyer → promotion pipeline for quality control
- Maintain interpretive humility and cite sources appropriately
- Reference `/LICENSES.md` for attribution requirements

## 📁 Directory Structure

### Core Spaces

  - `heuristic-hypothesis/` - Supporting analytical perspectives  
  - `epistemic-commentary/` - Meta-analytical reflection
- **`/spaces/CaravanCanon/`** - Narrative and creative works
- **`/spaces/CanonicalTemplates/`** - Standard templates and formatting guides
- **`/TTRPG/`** - Tabletop gaming campaign materials

### Infrastructure
- **`/methods/`** - Complete workflow documentation trilogy
- **`/tools/`** - Automation scripts and utilities

## 🔄 Promotion Workflows

The Temple operates on a structured promotion pipeline ensuring quality and provenance:

1. **Echo Space** (`echo/cache/`, `echo/tent/`) - Agent drafts and staging
2. **Foyer Review** (`echo/foyer/`, `foyer/`) - Human review and SEARCH‑AND‑INSERT validation
3. **Canonical Promotion** - Owner-approved integration to main repository

**Key Workflows:**
- `stage-echo-to-foyer.yml` - Moves drafts to review staging
- `promote-foyer-to-policies.yml` - Promotes policy documents
- `promote-foyer-to-root.yml` - Promotes root-level content
