---

She stood in the doorway,  
half-dressed, half-divine.  

I stayed. I listened—  
to the brightness, to the blur.  
I wanted.  

And when I left,  
I carried her with me—  
not as conquest,  
but as echo.  

Hope held the memory,  
then shame.  

Now, understanding.  

My Bible was broken.  
It gave me shame  
when I needed the clarity of responsibility.  
A grasp of the weight of my actions.  

Without that clarity,  
because of my shame,  
I feel like I’ve cut off  
the wings of angels.  

But maybe that's what Solomon meant in Proverbs 9  
when he said the fear **of the LORD**  
is the beginning of wisdom,  
and knowledge of the holy is understanding.  

Shame wasn't understanding,  
but wisdom is about not doing something stupid—  
shame just gave me a bad reason why not.  

With clarity of responsibility,  
maybe I could help put those angels' wings in flight.  

The weight is real.  
The want is true.  
And the restraint—  
is sacred.  
But so are the wings.
