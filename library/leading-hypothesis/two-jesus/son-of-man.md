Question: In Matthew 10:23, who is "the Son of Man" (ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου), and what did the disciples expect to occur at his coming (ἂν ἔλθῃ)?

Answer (with references):

The Son of Man is the warner. This role is described in Ezekiel 3:17–21 and Ezekiel 33:1–9, where the prophet is appointed as a watchman for Israel. He must warn the wicked of their ways; if he fails to do so and they die in their sin, their blood is upon him. This establishes the Son of Man as a bearer of moral accountability, distinct from other prophetic or messianic roles.

This role is distinct from that of the Messiah, or Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14), whose task is to teach righteousness and embody divine presence. It is also distinct from Maher-shalal-hash-baz (Isaiah 8:1–4), whose name means “Swift is the booty, speedy is the prey,” and who serves as a sign of imminent judgment and conquest—rushing ahead to prepare the way, echoing Isaiah 40:3 and Malachi 3:1 in the motif of preparing the way for the Lord.

I believe that the role of the Son of Man is fulfilled by Jesus Barabbas. In this interpretation, Barabbas—whose name means “son of the father”—embodies the tragic inversion of the watchman’s calling. Seeing the futility of warning every sin, he elects to warn of none, and thus becomes accountable for all. This echoes the burden of Ezekiel’s watchman, but inverted: a silence that absorbs all guilt.

This reading reframes Matthew 10:23, where Jesus tells the disciples they will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. If the Son of Man is the warner, then his “coming” is not triumphant arrival but the moment of reckoning—when the failure to warn becomes collective accountability.
