# **Chapter 2.** - Parable of Temptation
[Youtube Readalong Chapter 2:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iBjDP1PRSg&list=PL-552OoVgDd_eQyePWmeiArfHlqiNDLLz&index=2)  
**Location:** Jesus Barabbas visits Cana, then Jerusalem, while Jesus of Bethlehem wanders the wilderness near Galilee  

### Rhyme
Jesus (both Jesus) were led by the spirit -  
Out to the wilderness, tempted by serpent -  
Jesus Beth-Laham could never be tempted  
But Jesus Bar Abbas? he rushed to the spoils.

 ### Rhetoric
While most of the chapters of John’s gospel seem to be riddles about some particular common object, **Chapter 2** is an exception. 
Here, the subject of the riddle is another passage in another version of the gospels. 
In particular, the three events of **John 2**. parallel closely with the temptations of Jesus in **Matthew 4** and **Luke 4**. 
The three temptations offered by the devil were 1) Transmutation: The ability to change an object from one form to another 2) Invincibility: The ability to avoid or come back from certain death 3) Unlimited Wealth: The ability to take ownership of what everyone else has, wants, and needs. 
In John 2, Jesus accepts the ability to transmute water to wine. 
This poses a moral dilemma. 
Why was it “good” for Jesus to turn water into wine in this circumstance, but when he was hungry, it was “bad” to turn stones into bread. 
The general view is that it was “good” because, by performing a miracle Jesus convinced some of the people that he was divine. 
Whereas, it would have been self-serving to feed himself by turning stones into bread. 
I cannot help feeling that this is completely backwards. 
In other gospels, it is notable that Jesus NEVER performs a miracle for the sole purpose of convincing others that he is divine. 
To the contrary, every miracle performed by Jesus in the other gospels is done to feed, heal, or give comfort to those who are in need. 
In John’s gospel, these effects are sometimes secondary, but the primary purpose of the miracles of Jesus in John’s gospel are to prove his own divinity. 
2.

**1.** The First Temptation
---
 Beth Laham first tempted by stones-into-bread, -  
 Shook his head no, quoted scripture and said,   
 These stones are just fine to stay still in their bed   
 I don’t just need food but God’s words for my head.   

(**Matthew 4:1-4**) Barabbas need not hear the voice of the serpent,    
**14.** **3.** his mother was there wanting water to repent   
its form was not good enough for her to own   
she had no more use for it than bread from stone.  

**7.** reluctantly Jesus went through with the trick  
**6.** and servants poured wine from great barrels so thick   
if truly a miracle they saw that day,  
near two hundred gallons of water’s at play, 

(**John 2:6**) how much of this wine was drained into the sink,  
**10.** since all of the guests had had too much to drink? (**John 2:10**)    
**11.** The nobles and masses with brawlers and revelers   
Stayed up through the night, or passed out in their cellars. 

They drank until vomit from their stomachs burst   
While people of common birth were parched with thirst (**Isaiah 5:13**)   

**2.** The Second Temptation 
---
(**Matt 4:5-7**) He then proves himself invincible, when (**John 2:21-22**) Jesus is raised from the dead. 
Here again, one might ask why it was “good” for Jesus to die on the cross and come back to life, but it was “bad” for Jesus to throw himself off a high mountain and have angels catch him. 
As for these examples, I propose that Jesus Barabbas (**Matthew 27:16-17**) or, translated from Hebrew, Jesus “Son of the Father” actually did succumb to both temptations, or if he did not actually, it is enough that John’s gospel represents a “confession over the head of Barabbas” that he did these things. 
Even if Jesus Barabbas did nothing of the sort, it is reasonable, in following the instruction of Leviticus 16, that all the sins should be convessed over the head of the scapegoat, even sins that the goat is, itself, innocent of, and that a goat is not even technically capable of. 
Much more analysis of the actual trial and crucifixion of Jesus (Barabbas and Messiah) is given in Chapters 18-
**20.** 

Beth Laham was next tempted: Jump off a cliff!   
said Satan “No worries; you’re safe in a jiff!”  
 The Devil quotes scripture, says angels will come  
 lift up in their hands, so your foot won’t strike stone  
 
 Beth Laham says wisely “I’ll have none of this.”  
 for scripture says also God’s will not to test.  
Barabbas meanwhile has gone to Jerusalem  
made whips out of cords to chase out all of them,  

 sheep, cattle and dove sellers facing his zeal (**John 2:13-17**)  
  asked “Why in the world would you make this appeal?  
   we make a good profit from selling atonement   
   your anger is not quite enough to convince us  

**15.** but J. Bar did not mention any of that.   
his problem was simply they sold this and that.   
(**John 2:16**) Though not demonstrating why markets were trouble,  
 he said take the temple, reduce it to rubble.   

if you do this now, then I’ll prove to you then,  
 in three days I’ll build this place over again! (**John 2:19**)  
**20.** the stampede of cattle, doves fluttering around  
 the coins of all cultures, a mess on the ground,   
  
 this mad man demanding the temple steam-rollered,  
  only one conclusion, it’s type iI bipolar.  
**21.** the priests at the temple took him to the ground   
Kept him somewhere ‘til his mind was more sound   

for three days, they kept his feet from striking ground,  
**22.** and let him out healthy, unhurt, and unbound.   
he came out and said “I’ve been dead for three days.   
you see how I meant. Don’t try thinking your ways.  

**23.** believe in my name and your faith, it will do:  
 define what I Say to mean something that’s true!  

**16.** 2.**3.** The third temptation 
---
Then, many people “believed in his name” and apparently offered their testimony. 
This is sort of an inversion on the “Unlimited Wealth” because here, the people who believed in his name had testimony about themselves, and wanted or needed to give their testimony, but Jesus rejected it, and refused to entrust himself to them who had testimony to give. 
(**John 2:25**) Ultimately, though, even though Jesus, the Messiah, was offered all the wealth of the world, and he refused it, saying (In Matthew 4) “Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only”.  The response that Jesus gave described his own intent, and this intent was reinforced in **Matthew 6:9-13**, when he said “This is how you should pray:”. His description on how to pray, first of all, does not invoke Jesus as a go-between, but speaks directly to God, your Heavenly Father. 
It specifies what you should ask for, essentially, to have what you need for the day, and to have no worries. 
In Matthew, though, Jesus doesn’t ask to be worshiped, himself. 
He just gives advice on how to worship God. 
So, to that extent, that you trust his advice, Jesus asks for “belief”, but he never asks anyone to “believe” he is the only begotten son of God, nor does he try to convince anyone by doing miracles. 
To the contrary, in **John 2:23-25**, this is blunt. 
If you do believe in Jesus “Son of the Father” BECAUSE of the miracles, he does not entrust himself to you. 
What it comes down to is that if you’re devoting a lot of time simply trying to perform awesome feats of “believery” it’s like you’ve got an empty package (Jesus’ name?), and you’re determined to say that what’s in that package is true and good. 
You could, instead, be devoting your time to experience, so that you actively seek out what is true and what is good. 

### Rhyme
J. Beth was next tempted with all the world’s wealth.  
The Devil said “You need not take it by stealth  
All this is yours at a very low price,  
for worshiping you’ll get more value than lice.” 

But Jesus could tell what the serpent had offered,  
A world of no love,with wealth clotted in coffers  
But Jesus would not preach the gospels of cynics  
to say all are sinful, right to their appendix.

to profit off guilt and self doubt, like the Devil;  
 to claim man was made not from good but from evil 
 
 “God did not err. People shouldn’t feel lonely.  
Worship the good Lord, God, serving him only”  
the Devil came also to J. Bar that day,  
**23.** “your name is believed, now you’ll have your own way!”

**24.** Barabbas, though didn’t need any more coaching  
because his contempt was all ready for boasting  
“no masons, no smiths, and no poets, no artists  
**25.** I trust none of them for I know where their heart is.”
