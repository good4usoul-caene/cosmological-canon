**Chapter 3.** - Parable of the Elements 
---
[Youtube Readalong: Chapter 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y010sTP-om4&list=PL-552OoVgDd_eQyePWmeiArfHlqiNDLLz&index=3)

**Location:** Nicodemus visits Barabbas somewhere near Jerusalem; John the Baptist is questioned near Galilee. 

### Rhetoric
**John 3:18** mentions that “Whoever does not believe stands condemned because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son”. 
In the same way that getting the Riddle of the Sphinx wrong would get you eaten by the Sphinx, **John 3:18** promises that getting the name of Jesus wrong will get you condemned. 
This sort of gnosticism does not occur in the other gospels, such that getting a name incorrect, or not believing in a correct name would get you condemned. 
Readers of John’s gospel are not encouraged to be explicit in their belief. 
Rather **John 3:14-18** simply says to hold the Son of Man up like a snake, and believe in his name, but does not say what the name is, nor what to believe about that name!, Such a practice, of “believing in a name” while not being able to state, definitively, what the name is, nor being able to say precisely what you are supposed to believe about that name is an example of what Heraclitus says about people who “do not divide each thing according to is kind and see how it truly is.”

**1.** Confusing Nicodemus
---
 In this chapter, Jesus demonstrates an ineffective and insulting teaching technique. 
When his student asks a question, he says “You are Israel’s teacher and you do not know this?” This is actually a dodge. 
He does not answer Nicodemus question, which should have a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. 
But instead, he continues on, making several more ambiguous statements and rhetorical questions. 
Interpretations of these statements exist that are completely unremarkable. 
If he means “above” by “anothen” then it is completely unremarkable to say “You can’t be born a bird if your not from a bird.” A rhetorical question Jesus asks is “If you don’t believe me when I speak of earthly things, how will you believe me if I speak of heavenly things”. 
If the question were answered properly, it would be “I don’t believe you are speaking of heavenly things. 
I believe you are speaking of earthly things.” Once it is recognized that Jesus is simply speaking of air and water, rather than specifically of baptism and spirit, one realizes, you can’t be born of water unless you’re made of water. 
This is the idea that Jesus is trying to get across, to comical effect. 
Now most of the men from the temple had left him but some still thought he was a prophet to teach them some insight about the Jews’ laws and their practice some rule that had hitherto hid from the masses.
### Rhyme
**18.** When J. Bar was visited by Nicodemus,   
he came at night, secret, so no one would see this.  
He said to Barabbas “All things are from God,   
and you are a thing so not totally fraud.  

**2.** This shouting and kicking and screaming and boasting   
water into wine, having revelers toasting!   
No thing can be done without God saying “yes”   
so God has a plan for you, surely, I guess?”

**3.** Barabbas then answered in Greek with a pun:   
You can’t get to Heaven lest born “anothen” -   
Poor Nicodemus still struggled with Greek  
**4.** “crawl back in the womb? that seems absurd to seek.” 

but J. Bar persisted without explication   
and added “pneumatos” to his explanation.   
(Pneumatos means air, anothen: above.   
the air and the clouds are some signs of God’s love.

**6.** Don’t try to be born of the air or a cloud   
but let you be you, for crying out loud.   
-(There’s nothing stopping you learning to love   
while standing on ground with your spirit above.) 

do not be surprised you must be born above   
to be in the sky with the clouds and the dove   
Flesh begets flesh and plant gives birth to plant,  
 Kindness gets kindness and rant begets rant.

**8.** and the wind, oh the wind, now it’s hard to predict   
one day, it’s nice weather. The next won’t be fit!  
**9.** but J. Bar had spoken in riddles and puns   
Nicodemus, bewildered, while having no fun,

 asked “How can this be” in frustrated confusion   
 so J. Bar then mocked his esteemed occupation  
**10.** You’re Israel’s teacher, yet don’t understand   
(Water and weather and clouds versus land?)
 
**11.** We speak what we know, and to what we have seen   
Earthly things. You just don’t know what we mean.  
**12.** So how will you get it if I now describe   
those things you’ve not seen, and what hasn’t arrived? 

### Rhetoric
**John 3:13** seems to be saying there is something special about “The Son of Man”. 
However, it may also be an odd description of gravity; “What goes up, must come down, even the Son of Man”.
**13.** No one has gone up to Heaven unbound: No son has gone up except one whose come down.
**19.** **14.** one man must be lifted up just like a snake and kept there forever for history’s sake
**15.** by putting our sins in this man in his glory and keeping them out of our lives and our story
**18.** John’s gospel then calls this man “God’s only son.” He takes away sins, so give him every one.
**17.** he doesn’t condemn; just to trick us for fun, since we don’t know the name of “God’s begotten son” Though I can’t say for sure what John means by “the name”, there are a number of contenders. 
Trivially, people will say “Believe in the name of Jesus!” The name, “Jesus”, is considered an abbreviation for Yeshua, which means, in Hebrew, “Savior”. 
As such, to believe in the “name” of Jesus does not necessarily mean that you believe the person described in the gospel was the savior! It only means you believe in the word, “Savior”. 
As for what it means to believe in the word, “Savior”, that could mean you believe some savior is needed, or desired. 
Now, as for the surname, contenders include “Christ”, “Barabbas”, “of Nazareth”, “Of Bethlehem”, “the Messiah”. 
Such surnames can be used, if there are more than one Jesus, to designate which one we are speaking of. 
It is possible that **John 3:18** is referring to the surname of God’s only begotten Son. 
Belief in the name of Jesus, then could be the awareness and ability to distinguish between Jesus Barabbas, and Jesus, the Messiah. 
For a shorthand, I call the latter, “J. Beth” here, for Jesus of Bethlehem. 
I like this name, knowing that it translates in Hebrew to, “Jesus of the House of Bread” or “Jesus of the Flesh”. 
This contrasts with Jesus Barabbas, which means “Jesus, Son of the Father”. 
If one fails to notice that Barabbas means “Son of the Father”, can they say they have successfully believed in the “name”? Most people aren’t concerned with the name of Barabbas. 
Rather, they are looking at “Christ” or “Messiah”. 
Since those names simply mean “anointed one” it takes very little consideration to find it plausible that Jesus was anointed, either with water, perfume, oils or all three. 
I would also suggest the possibility that John is not referring to any Jesus, but to the word “And”. 
This word seems to be the answer to the riddle of **Chapter 12..** 
If “the Word was God” it seems that everything following God transpired with the passage of “and then”. 

### Rhyme
the world stands condemned when we miss J. Beth’s name,  
Beth Laham brought light, but J. Bar’s not the same.  
Barabbas gives cover for the evils some contemplate  
Doomed by disbelief, so what’s the point of showing restraint? 

they slither up and preach a nihilistic consecration   
“your evidence and status in this world are all illusion  
I have the only truth so you should cast your lot with me!  
 Jesus ‘Son of The Father’ grants eternal life, you’ll see.” 
 
 If you read between the lines, you really should have known   
 the life Barabbas boasted was eternal was his own.

**2.** The testimony of John the Baptist 
---
When John is asked about Jesus, he mentions one who is from heaven, then one who is from earth, then one who is from heaven again. 
This could be a reference to air, earth, and water (as cloud). 
Or it may be a reference to himself, Jesus Barabbas, and Jesus, the Messiah. 
Of these, Jesus Barabbas is from earth and speaks as one from Earth, about earthly things. 
However, since the earthly things are spoken of in riddles, one gets the impression that he speaks of heavenly things.

### Rhyme
**25.** the Baptist, John, was asked his attitude about the two   
to settle a debate his men had with a certain Jew  
**27.** John said “A person can receive what’s given him from Heaven   
Strength, and mind, and spirit; gifts more numerous than seven,

**28.** I am not Messiah, you can testify I said   
I’m neither goat or scapegoat but the bull that charged ahead  
**35.** Zechariah, my Father, belonged to ‘Abijah’   
the sect of Israelites who say ‘God’s my Father, Abba’ 
 
three wise men from the East told him my stars and theirs were crossed  
with three signs from the Heavens that would never be quite lost.   
As Jupiter outran Saturn in the Pisces fish that day  
 they’d both just come from Taurus. It’s the charging bull, they say. 

those planets crossed twice more that year and had conjunctions thus:   
the rams from Aries twice were washed in clean Aquarius   
two rams were washed, before two fish, with two spirits of water  
one ram for God, but cast by lot, and and one ram for the slaughter

**31.** but J. Beth clearly speaks his words there can’t be any doubt  
his heart is good, and glory to God is what he’s all about.  
**32.** the other, J. Bar, though perhaps, his spirit from above is   
his words do riddle, mystify, bewilder, and confuse us

**33.** he testifies to what he’s heard and what his eyes have seen,  
 but wraps it all in riddles so his words aren’t quite received.   
and so it’s come my time at last to charge straight up to Herod   
and shame him on adultery and get myself beheaded.
