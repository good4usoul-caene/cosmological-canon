# Chapter 10: The Parable of the Gate - Answer Key Template

**Title**: The parable of the gate  
**Setting**: Festival of dedication - Solomon's Colonnade - Jerusalem then (John 10:40) North to Galilee, perhaps?

## Verse Breakdown (For Manual Editing)

**1.** If a man has Built a fence aRound some sheep he'll Claim 
the Sheep are his, and All the sheep withIn, are His doMain. 
if In the night, a Man climbs up the Fence, there's much aMiss 
Probably a Thief, unless he's There to take a Piss.

**2.** but When the gate is Working Uunder Watchful eyes of Guards 
the Shepherds use the Gate to get their Sheep out Of the Yard 
but, Of the gate, there's More to boast than Mere sheep-theft preVention 
it Separates the Sheep among the Shepherds, what an inVention! 
for When each shepherd Seeks his sheep and Calls to them by Name 
his Sheep come out from In the flock and For him they are Tame.

**5.** but His same voice will Scare away the Others in the Flock 
while Fence and gate will Keep contained the Fullness of the Stock.

**6.** j. Bar said this to Pharisees who Couldn't grasp his Meaniing 
They rejected Words he spoke, or Some non-literal Leaning. 
he Made himself a Metaphor to Challenge all their Senses 
to Obfuscate the Simplest facts on Gates, sheep-yards, and Fences

**7.** since You don't see the Properties of Sheepyards, jesus Sighed 
i Offer you this Metaphor for Gate, truly it's I.

**8.** beFore the gate, the Sheep could not trust Those anywhere Near 
they're On their guard for Thieves and robbers Out on the fronTier.

**9.** but Once the gate (is) In its place, the Sheep (can) come and Go 
inTo the Fence to Keep them Safe, or Out to Graze and Grow

**10.** the Thief still wants the Sheep for it has Wool and it has Mutton 
the Same reasons the Shepherds have to Keep the sheep all Shut-in 
but Now the shepherd Doesn't Have to Spend all of his time Watching 
Sheep both day and Night, through summer, Winter-time.  (*meter fail?*)

**11.** the Gate draws open, Lets sheep in, lays Life down on the Ground 
Then lifts right (back) Up again, making Sheep feel safe and Sound.

**12.** a Shepherd runs aWay when predaTors attack the Flock 
a Gate will stay in Place, and keep the Flock safely in Stock

**14.** the Gate alLows the Sheep to pass; the Sheep, they know the Gate

**15.** the Gate-maker, he Knows the gate; goes Through, early or Late.

**16.** Shepherds come to Gather flocks withIn the gate's sheep-Pen 
the Gate's duty's to Keep them safe unDer it's jurisDiction

**17.** the Gate's designed to Open; lay down Life and stand back Up

**18.** auThority was Given for to Open and to Shut

**19.** some Jews who heard iDentiFied with Suffering of the Sheep
 though Safe, they felt, they Still were sheered or Slaughtered in their Sleep

**20.** they Did not solve the Riddle, nor did they Find themselves aMused 
So they called him Demon-possessed and With their words acCused

**21.** Others heard the Words and said "who Cares just what they Mean? 
the Riddler cured the Blindness of a Man whose never Seen!"

**22.** the Sheep pen was aRound the jews at Solomon's colonNade

**24.** they Asked it, tell us plain, are you mesSiah or stocKade?

**25.** said Gate, "i told you Plainly, but you Simply don't beLieve"

**26.** the Works i do for Gatemaker are For sheep to reCeive.

**27.** they Hear my squeak of Hinges and they Follow since their Trained 
and I allow them out to graze, or In to be resTrained

**28.** they're Fed to life, eTernal, never Perish of old Age

**29.** no Bandit ever Snatches them from In gatemaker's Cage

**30.** our Goals are so atTuned, i'd say, when All my work is Done 
a Tool's part of the Toolmaker. I, and he, are One.

**31.** but In the crowd there Didn't seem to Be a good code Breaker 
for Jesus' one-step Metaphor for Gate and for it's Maker 
They could see a Man, though he'd said Plainly "i'm a Gate" 
inStead of parsing Words to give asSent or to deBate 
they Saw this man and Reasoned that he Was an instiGator 
they Reasoned, then, that Being a man, god Must be his creAtor 
these Men considered Blasphemy to Be: to claim you're God. 
and Lined up all aRound him, a stone-Throwing firing Squad

**34.** but Jesus quotes psalm Eighty-two to Keep his riddle Tied 
how Gods are blind, and Mindless mortals Sons of the most High

**35.** if Scripture calls the Blind and mindless "Gods" then what's to Say

**36.** a Gate that serves the Function of it's Maker's not the Same?

**37.** If you see me Working like a Gate does for the Sheep 
beLieve the works so You may count the Sheep to fall aSleep.

**40.** then Jesus went back North again to Visit galiLee 
and Everyone who Followed there who Came to him to See

**41.** the One from earth who Speaks of earth, as John the baptist Said

**42.** They believed aBout him what was Right or was misRead.

## Instructions for Manual Editing

Please edit this file to show the ideal line breaks that preserve:

1. **Rhyme schemes** (claim/domain, amiss/piss, guards/yard, prevention/invention, name/tame, etc.)
2. **Stressed syllable balance** (I chose 4 stressed syllables per line, using capitalization)  
3. **Iambic meter** where present
4. **Theological meaning** and poetic artistry

Once manually edited, this will serve as the canonical answer key for training the enhanced parser to achieve optimal verse formatting.
