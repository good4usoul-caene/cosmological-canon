# The riddles of Barabbas Jonathan Doolin December 17, **2021.** 

§§CHAPTER_BREAK§§ 
## **Chapter 0.** - Two Jesus Hypothesis

[Youtube Readalong: Ch 0, 1A, 1B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgXhyWyzlwI&list=PL-552OoVgDd_eQyePWmeiArfHlqiNDLLz&index=1)

We’d better get cracking if names are your thing.  
You’re told to believe in them, it would be sane  
to learn what they mean, in Hebrew or Greek.  
Find out if a teacher or clown you do seek.  

My approach handling John’s gospel’s core discrepancy,  
is note the differences when apt, and stress this remedy:  
to guess two men are in these tales with so much variation.  
It’s irresponsible for us to fail delineation.  

So I’d suggest two names for whether shorthand or a fact,   
so Jesus “Son of Father”, “Son of Man” can interact.   

“Son of Father” In Hebrew, translates to just “Barabbas”  
depending on the rhyme I need, I’ll say “J. Bar”, “J. Bas”  
the other Jesus, he’s a man, with body made of flesh.  
so if I want to speak of him, I’ll say “J. lamb”, “J. Beth.”  

Barabbas spoke in riddles, which BethLaham was the rhyme  
for Bethlehem meant house of bread or meat, back in that time.  
No matter what the things we say; the truth or sophistry  
Words are what we use to tell the tale of history  

§§CHAPTER_BREAK§§ 
## Chapter 1A - The Parable of Language

### Rhetoric
 - Several interpretations present themselves for **John 1.** because of many ambiguities.
   - As John describes John, is he, in every sentence, referring to John the Baptist, or is he sometimes referring to himself? 
   - Why is the “Before me... After me” phrase repeated twice? (**John 1:15**, 30) Why is the Lamb of God introduced twice? (**John 1:29**, 36). 
   - Why is only one of the two men following Jesus identified? (**John 1:40**) 
   - Why does Jesus use a Greek translation for “Rock” for Peter’s name here, instead of just calling him “Peter” as he does in the other gospels? (**John 1:42**)
   - What did they see when the saw where Jesus was staying and what is the significance of four in the afternoon? (**John 1:39**) 
   - Why was Nathanael so impressed when Jesus said he saw him under the fig tree? (**John 1:48-49**) 
   - What are the implications of Nathanael’s question, “Can anything good from Nazareth?” considering that Jesus says “in him there is no deceit”? 
   - What does it mean to see“Angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man”? 
### Identity Witnesses

 - In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, there is an account that a voice from heaven boomed out “This is my Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
 - But in John’s gospel we have two second-hand witnesses. John (who sees a dove) and Nathanael (who sees a fig tree)
### John's Testimony of Identity 
 - John, who says, he is “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!”
   - If we relate this to *Leviticus 16*, there are two goats: One called “The Lord’s Goat” and another called “The Scapegoat”. 
   - The first is sacrificed, while on the other’s head, all the sin of the Israelites are confessed, and it is set free in the wilderness.
   - If John’s testimony is a reference to Leviticus 16, then,
     - we should expect John’s gospel to include the confession of all the sins of the Israelites
     - attributed to Jesus Barabbas, the scapegoat,
     - though he is by no means actually guilty of the transgressions shown.
### Nathanael's Testimony of Identity    
 - The other secondhand witness of *John 1.* is Nathanael, who says he believes Jesus is the Son of God simply on account that Jesus says “I saw you under that fig tree.” 
   - The rest of your impression depends on whether you think that Nathanael’s question “Can anything good come from Nazareth”
     - represents an earnest question, in which case Nathanael must have been a very cynical person, to believe a whole community could have “nothing good” come from there,
       - In this case, when J. Bar says "Here is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit" it makes a claim that cynicism is not deceitful.
     - or a sarcastic question, in which case Nathanael was not “An Israelite in whom there is no deceit”.
       - In this case, when J. Bar says "Here is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit" it makes a claim that sarcasm is not deceitful.
     - or he had bad experience in Nazareth, and was dubious that anything good could come from there.
       - In this case, when J. Bar says "Here is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit" it makes a claim that mostly or only evil comes from Nazareth.
     - In *Gospel According to Biff*, Jesus sizes up Nathanael’s condition, and concludes that the issue is with his disability, not his morality. 
       - When J. Bar says “Here is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit”, it makes a claim that ignorance should not be confused with deceitfulness.
### Riddle by Riddle
 - My working hypothesis is that each chapter of John’s gospel is a set of riddles. 
   - Something akin to “the Riddle of the Sphinx”, except that the reader is not actually told he is reading a book of riddles.
     - The Sphinx might also never have told Oedipus that it was asking a riddle.   
   - As an example, the riddle the Sphinx asked Oedipus in front of Thebes was,
     - “I go on four feet in the morning, two feet at noon, and three in the evening. What am I?”
     - Now, a person unfamiliar with this sort of riddle might answer “You are a Sphinx”, not realizing that
     - the Sphinx is not speaking of itself, but is speaking in a one-step metaphor. 
     - In the metaphor, morning, noon, and evening, represent, not a day, but the entire period of a person’s life,
     - and “I” represents not the Sphinx who is speaking, but a human being.
 - In the riddles of John’s gospel, I posit that each chapter is a different riddle, and
   - with each riddle Jesus speaks of himself metaphorically as a useful thing,
   - while he speaks of “The Father” metaphorically, as a human being or source;
   - the person or process that creates and/or benefits from that useful thing.
   - The Father might be any one of Aristotle's four causes: Material, Final, Formal, and...
 - Of the characters in John’s gospel,
   - only Jesus (J. Bar) and John the Baptist are aware that he is speaking metaphorically, in riddles. 
   - But they do not let on that they are speaking in riddles. 
   - Rather, they allow the people around them to believe that they are talking about Jesus and his relationship with God. 
### Chapter 1A Notes
 - I have worked my way through the first chapter of John twicel.
   - Chapter 1A assumes the “riddle(s)” of the chapter is/are about words. 
   - However, that riddle is divided up into different parts of speech, and how language is used. 
     - In particular, some verses are referring to the referential verbs, such as “Is, are, am, was, were, be.”
     - Others are referring to the conjunction: “and”.
### Fragments of Heraclitus
 - There are a couple of ways **John 1.** overlaps with the “Fragments of Heraclitus”. 
   - Fragment 2, for instance says
     - “Though this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it
     - when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all.
     - For, though all things come to pass in accordance with this Word,
     - men seem as if they had no experience of them,
     - when they make trial of words and deeds such as I set forth,
     - dividing each thing according to its kind and showing how it truly is.
     - But other men know not what they are doing when awake,
     - even as they forget what they do in sleep.”
   - Like John, Heraclitus spoke of “The Word” or “Logos”
     - as being that which “through all things come to pass”,
     - but Heraclitus recommends that people “make trial of words and deeds”.
   - By contrast, John describes the Word as being with God. 
      - and rather than asking his readers to “make trial of words”, he instead asks them to “believe”.
 - Another echo of Heraclitus is in Fragment 60,
     - “The way up and the way down is one and the same.”
     - This compares to **John 1:51** when Jesus tells Nathanael he will see angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man. 
  - but whereas John focuses on “belief” throughout his gospel, Heraclitus focused on weighing the words
  - There are several verses in the chapter that may refer to upcoming events 

## Rhyme 1A
 Created was the world by God, back in the lost beginning (**John 1:1**, **Genesis 1:1**)  
 Let’s parse this out, each word, so that our insight might be winning  
 - First, “in the beginning” tells a time, not too specific   
and then “created” gives our God the verb to be prolific  
with One phrase now, we have a time, a phrase proverbial   

Our verb, though, wouldn’t work without a subject, this is so.  
The Word is “God” to fill that blank where subject needs to be  
So, **Chapter 1.** verse **1.** of John: the “Logos” count is three.   

“Created” was a word with God, back in the lost beginning (**John 1:2**)  
And through creation galaxies and stars were set to spinning  
Without “created” nothing has been made that has been made (**John 1:3**)  
“Created”, for mankind, is light of life, faith undismayed (**John 1:4**) 

When God created night and day, the darkness separated (**Genesis 1:4**)  
But with created fire, the night-time darkness now just waited (**John 1:5**)  
There was a man who’s sent from God, Maher Shalal Hash Baz (**Isaiah 8:2-3**, **Luke 1:63**, **John 1:6**)  
To testify to all that was created was his cause 

He came as witness to the light of all things man created  
So through him all belief would be in things, on earth, located (**John 1:7**)  
But John, himself, was not that light, the fire that man created  
Instead, he came to testify, of God’s inseminated 

God’s image walked across the earth, in form, female and male (**Genesis 1:27**, **John 1:9**)   
God’s image made the world, in projects, small, or larger scale -  
Through God’s image, much was built, some without recognition  
While some built fire to show destruction was their life’s ambition 

Some received the name “created” as their life-long goal  
And to creative spirit there’s a blessing of the soul  
Creation gives the right to those believing in its name  
To be the images of God and acting just the same. 

No ancestry determines whether you can have this spirit  
And God gives everyone the opportunity to use it (**John 1:13**)  
Creation became flesh, and lives within and out among us  
All have seen the glory of Creation, surely we trust 

and we should view creation through a lens of hope and faith  
to know all was created with a mood of truth and grace (**John 1:14**)  
And of the phrase “And me and” John declared ”it is the latter  
surpasses me, for progress, it is made as though a ladder 

*All* of what is *built* is built on *what* comes from the *past*  
*Im*ages of God contribute *from* first day to last.  
Out of fullness from subsequent images of God,  
We receive new grace in place of grace, when grace is flawed (**John 1:16**) 

*No* one ever has seen God, ex*cept* for the Cre*a*tion  
No *sing*le man, no bird, no clan, no *pro*phet, and no nation  
The law, it came through Moses, and the grace through the Messiah  
And Truth it comes bizarrely through the Jesus named Bar Abba 

And *from* the bosom *of* Bar Abba *come* the words of *John* -  
Making known the one, begotten, *made* both near and yon. (**John 1:17**)   
A prophet, nor Elijah, nor Messiah, John was not (**John 1:18-21**)   
But *he* said, straight ways *for* the Lord, were *all* that should be sought (**John 1:22-23**) 

Low made high, and small made big, and dead things made alive,   
The valleys raised, the mountains low, Lord’s glory be derived (**Isaiah 40:3-5**)   
The pharisees, per*haps*, thought John, Mes*si*ah, he could purge   
with baptism the post-effects of sin or any urge 

But *John* said “Brood of vipers, this is *on*ly for repentance” (**Matthew 3:7-8**, **Luke 3:7-8**)   
With this alone, you’ll not achieve, all pardons or ascendance   
They asked ”Why bother baptizing if nothing comes of it   
and *you’ve* neither the *off*ice of Mes*si*ah, nor pro*phet*?” (**John 1:25**) 

Said John, ”With water I baptize, my process is symbolic   
with faith, a soul has different heart once passed through the hydraulic   
A better person will come out than when they went down in   
Resolved to make some better choices, less inclined to sin (**Matthew 3:11**, **Mark 1:4**, **Luke 3:3**) 

But if you come to me and have me dunk you just for show,   
Or thinking it’s a magic trick to take you high from low   
Another will come after me and I will not be fit   
to help untie his sandals when he gets right down to it (**John 1:27**) 

*All* this happened *in* the town of *Beth*any, that’s *where* -  
all the men that followed Christ would have feet-washing bare   
John would not be at that place, his head on Herod’s mantle (*allegedly*  
And Jesus washed the others’ feet, so untied all their sandals.) (**John 1:28**. **John 13:14-17**) 
“Look, the lamb of God” John said, for he already knew  
The one on whose life’s sacrifice, atonment’s coming through (**John 1:29**)  
Dying once in John nineteen, but also in John two   
John’s surpassed by one who comes before and after, true. (**John 1:30**)  

John the Baptist didn’t know the one was fore and after   
But after water, baptizing, he went to the hereafter   
Take care, now, here, John doesn’t say, this one has any right,   
to baptise with the fire, the spirit, or some holy light 

All he says, that this one, he cannot untie his sandals   
This lamb of God, is he a font of good deeds or some scandals? (**John 1:35-36**)   
Two of John’s disciples followed J. Bar, as though fated.   
One whose name was Andrew, and the other’s name’s not stated. 

J. *Bar* asks what they *want*, and so they *ask* him where he’s *stay*ing   
We readers stay untaught because the author is not saying.   
So if J. Bar taught something whether criminal or lawful,  
The knowledge has been hidden by the author of John’s gospel 

And if there is a reason to be hiding what they’re doing   
-Only two of three men’s names are told of, for pursuing. (**John 1:37-39**) -  
Once they’d gone with J. Bar for a mile or a meter   
-Andrew made the claim, “This is Messiah, here,” to Peter. 

-Peter made no claims of J. Bar’s rank or his position,   
But J. Bar chose to call him “Cephas” (notably NOT Peter)   
A different nickname from a different character and greeter.   
-(Though two words might mean the same in Greek and Aramaic,   
-People’s names don’t translate like some meaning algebraic) 
 
-On the next day Jesus said to Philip, “Follow me.” (**John 1:43**)  
-(*An*drew, Phil, and *Pe*ter, came from *Beth*saida, all *three*.) (**John 1:44**)   
So if J. Bar would lead them to the north shore of the lake  
-They could visit home and with their family take a break. 

Then Andrew found Nathanael and he told him truth or flaw  
We found who prophets wrote about, and Moses, in the Law   
-I won’t tell you book or verse, so you will have to guess   
just when they wrote of Son of Joseph, Jesus, Nazareth -Nazareth! 

Na*than*ael cried, Can *ev*er any *good* things come from *there*?   
The *ques*tion is rhe*to*rical, don’t *get* caught in this *snare*.   
An earnest question asks for want of knowledge to be known   
Sarcastic questions ask for humor’s sake or discord sown. 

Regardless, though, of the intent behind this man’s sarcasm   
The question wasn’t earnest, it’s sincerity was absent.   
So when J. Bar then gets to him he says ”Here is a man:   
an Israelite in whom there’s no deceit” but what’s his plan? -

John’s already shown this man’s sarcastic in his words   
To say there’s no deceit in him? That’s patently absurd.   
And if there’s no deceit in him then what does this imply  
about who comes from Nazareth; Is J. Bar coming by? 

Nathanael has to ask him “Really? Where do you know me?”   
And Jesus answers, “I just saw you sit under that tree.”   
Nathanael, then, continues with his sycophantic laud   
“You’re the King of Israel, the Holy Son of God!” -

J Bar. asked do you believe since I saw you there, sitting?   
-You’ll see more than that, the choirs of angels I’ll be splitting   
Since you claim belief, as though that’s something you have won,   
Angels are ascending and descending on the Son 

You just don’t know what you’ll see, so long as I’m around!   
Angels cannot tell if I point up or I point down!  

§§CHAPTER_BREAK§§
# Chapter 1B - First Forays 

### **Context**
 - I have now made two efforts to convert **John 1.** to rhyme. 
 - I have put the latter effort above, and the former effort below. 
 - When I started making rhyme to all twenty-one chapters, beginning with Chapter 1, I had not settled on an approach, and it was only somewhere around Chapter 5 or 6 when I committed to giving a rhyme based on each verse, in sequential order. 
 - **1.** John the gospeler 
   - **John 1.** refers to John multiple times, without giving a surname, before he explicitly refers to John the Baptist. 
   - **John 1:15** and **John 1:30** are almost identical, but could hint that the two men both made the same statement 
   - “He who comes after me was before me” and such a statement could mean a number of things, since before and after can represent both physical and chronological positioning. 
 - **John 16** describes when the Spirit of Truth comes, he will speak only what he hears and tell you what is yet to come. 
   - It would be consistent with the Spirit of Discretion to simply not say my first impression of “What is to come”. 
   - However, the Spirit of Confession, and the Spirit of Truth should compel most adults to acknowledge that “To Come” is a colloquial expression for orgasm. 
   - Furthermore, the synonymous nature of “to Come” and “to orgasm” is not a mere homonym, but is rather a fundamental existential statement about 
     - the onset of puberty, and 
	 - the coming of adulthood. 
     - When done a certain way, orgasm leads explicitly to the **coming** of a child. 
   - Furthermore, many of the statements throughout John’s gospel will be found to be true on some fundamental level. 
   - However, such truths can only be obtained by allowing for an ironic reading and interpretation of the text. 
   - In the case of “What is to come”, one expects, ofr instance, the Spirit of Truth will predict the future, but in fact, the Spirit of Truth does not have that mystical capacity. 
   - Instead of presuming the miraculous ability for the Spirit of Truth to see into the future (which to most, might seem the less bizarre interpretation), I presume the Spirit of Truth has the capacity for confession and acknowledgment of facts and realities, and the ability to seek plausible hypotheses, (which most might find bizarre) 

### Rhyme
**6.** A man came from God, he was sent making riddles  
**7.** and he’d testify of things both big and little  
**8.** He did not make anything more clarified 
through witness, bi*zar*rely in *truth* certi*fied*

### Rhetoric  
 - **7.** Some may doubt the miracles reported by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, but the moral teachings of Jesus in the three gospels preceding John were fairly unambiguously “Good”. 
 - On the other hand, the moral teaching of Jesus in the gospel of John are largely absent. 
 - The closest thing he gives to instruction is telling his disciples to “love each other”. 
 - This is much less encompassing than what he says in every other gospel, “Love God with all your heart, all your mind, all your strength, and love one another (even your enemies) as yourself”. 
 - Here, also, many atheists may complain that they do not believe God exists, but I would point, here, to the operative word “mind”. 
 - What atheists are doing is to disbelieve a description of God which they cannot love with their mind. 
 - Usually, though, such atheists embrace principles with heart, mind, and strength.

### Rhyme
**9.** while J. Beth, Messiah, gave light to all man
**10.** - John’s gospel’s part’s an inscrutable plan
**11.** - *Though* John des*cribed* things in *truth* with no lies 
those *read*ing his writing could *not* recognize

**12.** - Things made by men, he, through riddle, would laud
**13.** ‘til *read*ers would say each thing’s *the* Son of God. 

### Rhetoric
 - I have offered two different interpretations of **John 1:1-15**. 
 - In one interpretation, I have suggested that the different verses referred to specific words, or types of words, or figures of speech. 
 - Here, though, I am suggesting that John is talking about the book of riddles he has composed... 
 - In each chapter 1-17, John poses a riddle of “Who” or “What” is Jesus, and “Who” or “What” is “the Father”? In these riddles, often, but not always, Jesus is definitely not a human being, but often some tool, creation, or invention of a human being. 
 - Often, but not always “The Father” in these riddles is the human being who created or uses that tool. 
 - Those inanimate objects who received the name of Jesus, he gave the right to become children of God. 
 - John presents these inanimat objects as being human, and not just any human, but the only begotten Son of God, human. 
 
### Rhyme
He starts some words that he makes into flesh, 
so let’s have a look at this metaphor, fresh. 

### Rhetoric
 - **2.** And **John 12:28** in the original Greek has a curious expression, when Jesus asks “Father, glorify your name” the voice says “And I have glorified. 
 - And will again.” The name of the Father seems not to be stated, but the word “And” (Greek kai) is repeated twice. 
 - Why would John glorify “And”? Namely for its use in the ambiguity of apposition, and its use to simply convey chronological order. 
 - As for chronological order, one could argue that any phenomenon that occurred after God occurs after the first “and”. 
### Rhyme
*What* word would come ‘round be*tween* noun and noun. 
*What* is the distance be*tween* freed and bound?
**8.** *What* word does God put be*tween* Earth and sun? 
*What* word without which no *thing* can be done? 
I *tell* you and tell you and *tell* you both, and 
I *rid*dle you this and I *hide* it in hand. 

For *Greeks*, Jesus asked, “Father *Glo*rify your name” 
*“And”* has been glorified, *“And”* will again. (**John 12:28**)
**14.** *“And”*, the word, flesh became, *through* metaphor 
*Dwell*ing with us, telling *us* what’s in store 
If *not* for the “And” the world’s *emp*ty, forgotten 
*No* new thing’s without the *on*ly begotten 
Just *think* what we’d be with no *con*cept of “And!” 
A*lone* with not even a *con*cept of sand.

**15.** John *said* of the phrase “and me *and*” it’s the latter 
sur*pass*es me, progress is *made* like a ladder.
**18.** *God* repeated “And” to set the *un*iverse in motion 
*From* the bosom of a man, we *can* repeat this notion 
*God* is never seen directly *in* the eyes of man 
but *we* have a connection through re*peat*ed use of and. 

If *“Both”* and “and” were words I said were *“With”* in the beginning, 
by *not*icing the play of words, the *rid*dle, you’d be winning. 
“*God* With Us”, *is* Immanu*el* as pre*dic*ted 
*but* “With” us through *time*, “With” has *been*, unre*strict*ed.

**16.** From fullness of “And” grace is given and given:
**17.** the grace of the law by which Moses was driven, 
The grace by which J. Beth has so far forgiven, 
and now in this chapter John’s gospel has striven 
to present the “Truth” in some words oft misgiven 

When *“and”* in conjunction cre*ates* ambiguity 
Those *seek*ing consensus find *dis*continuity 
One *might* find the same, or dif*fer*ent propostions. 
For “*and*” can show cause, or con*vey* apposition 
A *list* or identity; *you* cannot know 
If *auth*ors do not make pre*cis*ion their goal 1.
### Be; Rhetoric
 - Not all of **John 1.** seems to be about “And”. 
 - Some is about “Be”. 
 - Alternate forms for Be include is, are, was, were, will be. 
 - In particular, it seems that John here refers to the word “with God in the beginning”. 
 - The Hebrew word for “Create” is “Bara” which goes along nicely with the central thesis of this document, which is to say that Jesus Barabbas is actually the central character of John’s gospel. 
 - “Bara” (Create) is the name with God in the beginning. 
 - Without that word, nothing could be created.
### Rhyme
**1.** Through *word*, the God of *Mo*ses made the *world* of his de*sign*
**9, 2.** *Light*, land, plants and *oc*eans, stars and *crea*tures, then man*kind*
**3.** but *don’t* neglect the *oth*er words, the *ones* you over*looked*: 
the *ref*erential verbs and the con*junc*tions do the work 

How *much* could one impart to magni*fy* the mysticism 
by *us*ing referential verbs in *anth*ropomorphisms? 
If “Is” and “Am” and “Was”, “will be” were once as “he” described 
“Who is he?” would have the answer, “Is” contextualized. 

- *What* word “is” come between *word* and connotation - 
*What* word im*plies* being *and* classifi*ca*tion? 
To de*fine*, interpret, de*ter*mine a meaning, (**John 1:15**) 
the *light* of life, “Is”, is *al*ways revealing

**4.** When *God* brought a beast before *Ad*am and called 
“*What* do you think this beast *ought* to be called?” 
Adam began to form words with his mouth 
to name all the livestock and birds and the trout. 

*Each* beast and bird had u*nique* marks and features 
but *one* or two syllables *summed* every creature. 
This symbolic thinking was really a feat 
known only to those walking on two hind feet 

They had to use verbs of peculiar type: 
These verbs, referential, don’t get too much hype 
when anthropomorphized I say these are me, 
and you can call me the words “Is”, “Are” or “Be” 

### **4.** Becoming; Rhetoric
- **John 8.** is suggestive of the properties of fire; the light of the world, and the light of man. (or perhaps the firey pain of a painful bowel movement)
 - I can’t say for sure whether **John 1:5** is talking about fire, or the light of inspiration that fills mankind with the desire to create.

**5.** *Pro*tons, electrons, and *plas*ma in motion 
what *words* must be, *be*fore be*com*ing cre*a*tion? 
what *sub*stance, what phase of what *mat*ter I am? 
the *an*swer was even be*fore* Abraham! 

there was, and now is, and will be every gram. 
Matter and energy, “Plasma” I am! 
In time of John, that name, I had not acquired, 
but they called me simply the substance of fire! 

### **5.** Jesus Barabbas; rhetoric
 -  This section of the poem makes reference to how Jesus Barabbas is treated in the gospels. 
 - He is blamed for a great many problems, then set free, like the scapegoat of Leviticus
 - **16.** Some sources associate the name of Azazel with this scapegoat, while others associate the name Azazel with the Devil.

### Rhyme
**10.** Pardoned by Pilate to roam Rome and rob us. 
there was a man Jesus, they called him Barabbas (**Matt 27:16**) 
he hid in plain sight though no one could find out. 
His criminal deeds were too many to count 
His list of sins long as Azazel’s the goat. 
His teachings forever be with us, he’ll gloat. 
Set free in the forest, not noticed or dead, 
all sins of Israel confessed on his head 1.

### **6.** John the Baptist ; Rhetoric
 - Here, I posit that on separate occasions, John baptized Jesus of Nazareth (or Bethlehem) and also Jesus Barabbas. 
 - When John the Baptist says “He will take away the sin of the world” he would have been pointing, he does not say exactly how this sin will be taken away. 
 - Again, going back to Leviticus 16, one goat is slaughtered as a sin offering, but another goat takes away the sin of the world. 
 - If John knew the upcoming crucifixion of Jesus Christ would be based on the Day of Atonement ritual, it would be reasonable to imagine he knew which Jesus would play which role. 
### Rhyme
What *word* means to Christen, im*merse*, and recruit? 
To *bap*tize is generally the *Chris*tian pursuit. 
Baptism by water can make clean wheat muddy. 
It’s all such a mess, the floor should be made floody, 

but if there’s a piece of good wheat in that trash 
a winnow fork could sift the wheat from the chaff. 
The Baptist named John could tell what he was washing. 
Not everyone went away clean. he was watching. 

Barabbas: more clever than ten men by half, 
and John knew a man with (great?) deeds in his path 
the Baptist had two men who could help keep track 
One name’s reported the other, we lack.
 
He told his men Andrew and “Blank” to watch some, 
saying that this man “is God’s chosen one.” 
Chosen for what, though, he does not quite say: 
A lamb for the slaughter or one to obey? 

Now, *And*rew thought he under*stood* (but not quite,) 
said “*We’ve* found Messiah”  - (*That* is the Christ)
### **7.** First lessons of Barabbas; Rhetoric
 - In other gospels, when Simon expresses his faith in Jesus, Jesus calls him Peter, a Greek masculine noun meaning, basically “The Rock”. 
 - But when Jesus first meets Simon in John, Jesus calls him Cephas: a Hebrew feminine noun, meaning a big rock. 
 - In neither case do the gospels say whether Simon took his new nick-name as a compliment, but it seems, at least, possible, that he might have viewed “Cephas” as an insult. 
 - Moreover, the sleight is almost undetectable, but it could be an example of one of “all the sins of Israel” that is confessed over Jesus’ head. (**Leviticus 16:21**) 
### Rhyme
As these men then followed this Jesus that day 
The Christ began Christening one right away. 
Barabbas’ first lesson is change peoples’ names. 
*Keep* - the general *mean*ing the same. 

the *size* and the gender of *ob*ject don’t matter 
and *use* euphamisms to *add* to the laughter. 
Don’t *ask* if they mind, or ask “*Will* this please us?” 
just *take* a Peter and then *make* him Cephas. 

### Rhetoric
 - In other gospels, as soon as Jesus is baptized, a voice comes from heaven saying “This is my Son, whom I love”. 
 - While one may be in doubt that this miracle actually happened, it conveys the faith of the authors, Matthew, Mark, and Luke. 
 - In John’s gospel, though, the post-baptism confirmation of Jesus authority comes, not from above, but from Nathanael. 
 - Nathanael’s first question is “Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” To most thoughtful readers, this question should send up a red flag: It suggests that Nathanael has a tendency toward making sarcastic and cynical statements. 
 - However, Jesus has the opposite reaction, saying “Here is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.” By attributing sincerity to one who appears insincere, Jesus flatters Nathanael with falsehood, seemingly for the purpose of reciprocal testimony. 
 - Nathanael, taken aback by the praise, asks, “How do you know me?” Jesus replies, “I saw you under the fig tree.” Being thoroughly unimpressed, Nathanael piles his sarcasm higher and deeper, saying “Truly you are the Son of God, the King of the Jews!” However, it is not as though Jesus Barabbas has no sense of humor. 
 - He quips “You believe because I saw you under a tree. 
 - But soon you will see angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man.” Angels ascending on the Son of Man will be quick to tell you that this refers to when Jacob saw a ladder to heaven, but those descending will tell you this is an innuendo for a certain category of explicit fantasy.
 - “The way up is the way down” is a saying of Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher of 500 B.C. 
whose philosophy almost certainly influenced John’s writing in this chapter. 
### Rhyme
and then in Nathanael he found his first witness 
a man of sarcasm, a cynic, a wit, 
“Son of God, Rabbi, and King” he professes 
(All in the tone of a man unimpressed is.)

**12.** Barabbas says “Soon you will see more than that.” 
like petting a dog or beating a cat. 
the angels of God and those of good intent. 
in profane decline and in righteous ascent. 
In my name, Jesus, find teacher and clown, 
I will convey, “the way up’s the way down”
