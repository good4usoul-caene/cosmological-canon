1 Introduction, The principle of the second trinity (Jonah 2 - 2 Samuel 22:20-32).  
2 In order to understand what is the meaning of life. 
3 In order to understand the scriptures of the new testament, which contain stories about the life of 
Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles, and also the writings of his apostles. 
4 In order to understand the holy writings of the religion of the Hebrews Bible that make up the old 
testament.  
5 It is necessary to make a clear distinction between the man Jesus who has departed the world there 
is nearly two thousand years. 
6 And Jesus the only begotten Son of God who is the Christ and the firstborn of the creation of God. 
7 The one who came into the world in the form of a man, and who stayed in the world while sitting 
at the right of his father.  
8 If we can say that the only begotten son of God is our God, it is only because he is the only way to 
the true God.

1 Overview. 
2 Indeed, and it is necessary not to be wrong, it is not a man that we must believe to have eternal 
life. 
3 But it is in the one who came down from the sky and who went back to sit down to the right of his 
father.  
4 There are deaths who have been resurrected according to the texts of the Gospels, but no 
resurrected one has ascended into heaven (John 7:18).   
5 This document should help to understand the gospel (John 3:13-21).  
6 The principle of the trinity (God the Father, and God the Son, and God the holy spirit), which I 
propose to call the first trinity, can be described as follows. 
7 The creator, who is God the Father, is described in the Bible by rather special events that he has 
organized.  
8 Among others, he has announced by various authors the coming of his only begotten son in the 
world, the coming of God the Son (Genesis 49:10 - Psalms 2:7-12 - Isaiah 50:4-11).  
9 And since Jesus the man has risen from the dead to sit at the right of his father in heavenly places, 
men can receive God in their hearts in the form of the holy spirit who is called God the holy spirit 
(John 7:38-39 - 15:26 - Ephesians 2:22 - 1 Corinthians 3:16 - 1 John 4:6).  
10 I state the principle of the second trinity (Jesus the God, and Jesus the only begotten Son of God, 
and Jesus the man) as follows.  
11 The expression Jesus the God stems from the fact that it must be admitted that even if he spoke 
with great mischief, Jesus the man has never lied since his birth from a virgin woman until his 
installation on the right of his father (John 8:44,54-55 - Ephesians 4:21-24).  
12 And Jesus the only begotten Son of God is the Christ. More precisely it is the concept of love of 
the general interest, the explicit form of the unique command given by Jesus the man. 
13 He came into the world in the form of Jesus the man, and he did not leave the world after the 
departure of Jesus the man (1 John 3:6 - John 14:6 - Ephesians 1:20-23). 
1641 
14 The one who denies that everyone's objective must be to participate in the general interest, this 
one is certainly a liar (1 John 2:22-23).  
15 The set of all men of all nations who have the circumcised heart is the church. It is this set that is 
the body of the only begotten son of God (Ephesians 4:14-16 - 1 Corinthians 12:27 - 1 Peter 2:9-10 - Romans 12:4-5). 
16 With the second trinity, on the one hand faith and the possible associated persecutions do not 
necessarily consist in taking an interest in Jesus the man but unquestionably in Christ.  
17 On the other hand, messianic prophecies become a little less obscure because we can see that 
some are written about Jesus the man (Isaiah 53).  
18 And some others are written about Jesus the only begotten Son of God whose body is the true 
church (Isaiah 42:1-9).  
19 And some others are written about both (Isaiah 52:13-15). 
20 Faith consists only in loving God with all your heart and in loving your neighbor as yourself 
(Luke 10:25-28).   
21 More concretely, since God is simply the notion of truth in christianity as I will expose it in the 
section 'The identity of God', faith consists in loving everyone in general and not trusting anyone in 
particular (1 Timothy 5:24).  
22 I am writing this document because I would have liked someone to do it for me when I started to 
be interested in the content of the Bible in early March of 2014. Previously, it had already happened 
to me open a Bible, two or three times, to search methodically the interest of its contents.  
23 But I had always started with the first pages of the book, and I had always been discouraged after 
the first two chapters of Genesis because I did not understand what was God's pilosity, and his exact 
hairstyle, at the moment when he breathed a breath of life into the nostrils of the man he had created 
in his image.  
24 I had then convinced myself that this book could only be a collection of poems expressly 
conceived to comfort, under different circumstances, those who need to be comforted.  
25 Thus, before the end of 2013, I did not know what the terms old testament and new testament 
mean, nor the words gospel and apostle which had a comic connotation in my mind.   
26 I did not study the entire contents of the old testament to conceive of this work (John 6:43-46).  
27 On the subject of my willingness to share what I understood from my investigations, I must say 
that I never received an order or a promise like the apostle Paul. I am simply the work of God, as 
each of between us.

1 The identity of God.

2 Science aims to establish knowledge about the work of God and experiment is then used to purify 
speculations, while the holy scriptures reveal the will of the creator.  
3 It is written that God knows in advance those who will have eternal life consequently his word 
must come where it is needed to convince those who must be through this procedure. 
4 The sky, which is the throne of God, is the place of residence of abstract concepts.  
5 God is the notion of truth, and Christ who is his only begotten Son is the notion of love of the 
general interest, and all souls have been created in the image of God and are also abstract concepts. 
The hand of God is the laws of nature that scientists seek (John 14:9-10 - 1:18 - 4:24 - Romans 
1:20-23 - 1 Timothy 6:16 - Isaiah 48:12-13 - Jeremiah 23:23-24 - Psalms 139:6-12 - John 6:61-63 - 
1 Corinthians 15:35-38,42-50 - Luke 20:34-38 - John 12:23-26).   
6 God creates the spirit of man in his image, and no element of creation, being alive or being inert, 
is the creator.  
7 The story of creation is necessarily a metaphor chosen by the holy spirit to describe a complex 
process that it is up to us to specify. 
8 Because God loves that man seeks him, he wants all men to reason like scientists and that there be 
no idolater (Isaiah 45:18-20 - Acts 17:24-31 - Psalms 146:3-6 - Isaiah 2:22).  
9 The body of man is not in the image of God, and the chronology which is exposed in the story of 
creation (three days, morning and evening successions, are elapsed before the creation of the sun) 
was not conceived from a human perspective (2 Peter 3:8). 
10 Even the discovery of a form of extraterrestrial life cannot question the nature of God and the 
word of God. 
5 Rommel 4  
1 The purpose of life.  
2 We are genetically children of our parents, but we are necessarily creations of God (Isaiah 45:9
12).  
3 Life is a pilgrimage.  
4 The only purpose of life is the circumcision of the heart of God's elect (Daniel 12:2-3).  
5 If a human has a circumcised heart from birth, then this human is the incarnation or reincarnation 
of a spirit who is already a son of God, like the man Jesus or John the Baptist (4 Rommel 14:12).  
6 No other human can be born with the circumcised heart (Romans 3:4 - 1 John 1:8-10 - Psalms 
51:5-8 - John 3:3-8).  
7 This circumcision is done by the hand of God when one confesses the only begotten son of God, 
in other words when one realizes that it is always necessary to think and act out of love for the 
general interest without ever meditating any injustice against anyone, and without ever engage in 
any form of idolatry (Colossians 3:5-11 - Ephesians 5:6-11 - 1 Peter 1:22-23,24-25 - 2 Peter 1:1-8). 
1643 
8 All the sins of the one who accepts the only begotten son of God in all aspects of his life are 
automatically forgiven (2 Peter 1:9-10 - Luke 11:34-36 - John 13:10-11 - Luke 5:17-26).  
9 By definition, and it must be understood that it is a definition, every person who has the 
circumcised heart automatically has the holy spirit and is a member of the body of Christ, even if 
the man Jesus is not known to this person (4 Rommel 6:46), as it is written (John 4:23 - Ephesians 
1:13 - Galatians 3:26 - 2 Corinthians 3:18).  
10 We understand then that, if all sins are forgiven by the confession of the only begotten son of 
God, then no particular ritual is necessary to have eternal life, not even the ritual of baptism (1 Peter 
3:21-22). 
11 Any form of idolatry is incompatible with the justice of the heart that characterizes anyone who 
has confessed the only begotten son of God, because idolatry inevitably inculcates hatred (Luke 
16:13). 
5 Rommel 5  
1 Objective of the holy scriptures and the sacrifice of the man Jesus. 
2 The apostle Paul says that the purpose of the scriptures is to prepare the reader for the trials of life 
(2 Timothy 3:16-17 - Romans 15:4 - 1 Corinthians 10:11).  
3 It should be noted that the scriptures can be categorized as follows: the period of creation extends 
from the creation of heaven to that of the Garden of Eden. And the period of the patriarchs extends 
from Adam and Eve to Moses. And the period of the law and the prophets extends from Moses to 
Zechariah. [I said Zechariah because of the words of Jesus who spoke of a certain Zechariah in 
Luke 11:47-51, but I could also have said Malachi who seems to be the last prophet to have left a 
written revelation in the Hebrew Bible, and it may seem more appropriate to say John the Baptist 
who is the last major prophet to have lived before the final revelation of Jesus Christ.]   
4 And the last hour, or the end of the centuries, or the coming century, is the period that extends 
from the coming of the Just with his messenger and his apostles (John the Baptist - Jesus - Paul - 
Peter - John) until the second advent. 
5 From a qualitative point of view, we can distinguish the generation of prophets stretching from 
Adam to Jesus, and the generation of the last hour, which begins with the introduction of the holy 
spirit into the world, and which will end at the second advent. 
6 If all the scriptures come from a particular people, and are expressed in a particular language, it is 
legitimate to ask why other peoples should be interested in it with confidence.  
7 It must be noted that God has been able to manifest himself in different ways to other peoples of 
the earth, because by definition the law is addressed to those who have not naturally received the 
gift of discerning by themselves the way of Justice. 
8 Indeed, God in whom there is no injustice did not choose the people of the Hebrews to testify that 
he makes a difference between the souls he created in his image. 
1644 
9 But he chose them to reach those to whom he has not give the ability to find him by other means 
(1 Timothy 1:8-11). 
10 God hid his identity and that of his only begotten Son to the writers of the old testament. 
11 He was called in different ways (YHWH - God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob - Lord). 
12 And he scrambled the tracks by addressing the prophets through angels represented in their 
visions from a human perspective.  
13 Thus, the descendants of Abraham according to the flesh could have imagined that their God 
belonged to them and was locatable in space and time (Genesis 28:10-22). 
14 And they maintained the tradition of genealogies according to the will of God.  
15 But in reality the promises of the scriptures concern all the righteous of all nations (1 John 2:29 - 
Ephesians 3:3-6 - 1 Timothy 1:3-4 - Titus 3:9).  
16 In declaring himself apostle of the Gentiles several times, Paul encouraged the translations of his 
writings which are sufficient to understand what is to be understood, without being disturbed by 
falsifications which the enemies of the gospel may introduce elsewhere (2 Timothy 3:14-15).  
17 The purpose of the scriptures, therefore, is to convince those who are to be convinced by this 
means. Because it is enough to say few things to certain people so that they understand what is 
essential (Romans 10:17). 
18 Thus, God raised men among the Hebrews to fulfill his purpose (Romans 10:14). God has 
therefore chosen Abraham to bring forth through his flesh a people through which he will state the 
laws that lead to the righteousness of the heart, which is the righteousness of God.  
19 But laws clearly stated in this way constitute a curse because they are necessarily incomplete.  
20 For example, based on the ten commandments, if a Hebrew is attacked on a sabbath by someone 
who wants to make war on him then must he defend himself and disobey the law or must he obey 
the law and let oneself be slaughtered so as not to have sin. 
21 Thus Hebrews who are righteous in their hearts can be guilty according to the law, and deeply 
dishonest Hebrews can use the letter of the law to do criminal acts without God being able to 
convict them as guilty, for example by letting a patient die rather than performing an operation on 
the sabbath.  
22 Thus, all those who were under the law were sinners, either with respect to the law for those who 
wanted to be righteous or with respect to justice for those who wanted to obey the law (1 John 4:10 - 1 Timothy 1:15 - Galatians 3:22 - Romans 11:32-36). [When Jesus of Nazareth performed 
miracles on the sabbath days, those who approved him acted well according to their point of view, 
since Jesus was doing good to people who were suffering, and those who condemned Jesus acted 
well according to their own point of view, since they had the desire to sanctify the sabbath day as it 
was commanded to them in the law given by Moses. It can be noted that two different reasons have 
been stated to justify the commandment concerning the sabbath day (Exodus 20:8-11 - 
Deuteronomy 5:12-15).] 
1645 
23 Since the law itself is a curse simply because of its existence, the necessary end of the law is 
marked by the fact that it is used to justify the murder of the man Jesus who has always been 
absolutely irreproachable according to justice of the heart, and therefore pleasing to God from his 
birth through a virgin girl to his crucifixion.  
24 And the apostles confirm this reality (John 5:18 - 1 Peter 2:22-25).  
25 It is the law given by God which is the exact justification of the death of a person whose guilt 
cannot be recognized in any of the actions he has practiced throughout his life. And this injustice 
provoked by the law is an act of jurisprudence that makes the law condemnable before God.  
26 So God stops using the law to judge the Hebrews who were under this law, and he gives justice 
to the man Jesus by raising him from the dead (1 John 4:9).  
27 Since it was God who had enunciated this cursed law, the punishment fell on his own son, who is 
not the son of a man (Galatians 3:13-14).  
28 This whole story is about the people who received the law (Romans 3:19-20).  
29 As soon as the law becomes condemnable before God, the new tool for the judgment of the 
world is the tool that was in the beginning, the tool that was used before the coming of the law by 
Moses namely the justice of the heart (Galatians 5:13-14 - Romans 13:8).  
30 The scripture however said that the gospel has been also announced to the dead. Perhaps this is a 
way of informing us that some of the dead, since Abel, are being sent back to the world so that they 
can reach the circumcision of their hearts, so that all those who have been predestined will find 
themselves on the right side on the day of judgment.  
31 I think that in the day of judgment all souls will leave their body envelopes but some will inherit 
eternal shame, and others will inherit eternal life by constituting what was good in Adam the first 
man because truth cannot exist without lies but truth can be separated from lying. 
32 And because the gospel teaches us that the only begotten Son of truth is the love of the general 
interest who is Christ (1 Peter 3:18-19 - 4:6 - 1 Corinthians 15:51-53). 
33 What has changed from the beginning, what in which the law has been useful, is that the people 
are now educated about the nature of God and the purpose of life. 
34 They are instructed by all those who announce and distribute the word of God in all nations, to 
the ends of the earth (Romans 15:8-12 - Luke 16:27-31).  
35 The righteousness of the heart is simply fulfilled by the ten commandments among which the 
four that specify concrete actions (and not thoughts) must be mixed with the notion of love.  
36 All souls have the same price before God (Romans 3:21-24 - Galatians 4:4-5 - Galatians 5:1 - 
Ephesians 2:13-18).  
37 So if everyone is justified only by the justice of his heart then in a certain sense everyone is 
Jewish (Romans 2:28-29 - Romans 3:1-3). 
1646 
38 Personally, I think that those who received the circumcision of the flesh already have their 
advantage, and that the law and Moses were for the Hebrews what Paul and his epistles were for the 
Gentiles. 
39 The goal of these two men was to inculcate the beginnings of wisdom in their audiences (2 
Corinthians 3:14-17 - Galatians 3:23-25 - Colossians 2:17 - 1 Corinthians 2:6-8,14-16 - Isaiah 
28:23-29).  
40 It is permissible and recommended not to abide by the ten commandments in certain situations, 
and this fact can already be seen in the laws given by Moses as I mentioned in the section 'The 
humor of the holy scriptures' (John 5:39-40,41-47).  
41 And we know that the just will live by faith (Habakkuk 2:4). And there is no faith in the 
righteousness of the heart where there is the law (Galatians 3:10-11,29). 
42 The notion of posterity according to God does not come from the bonds of the flesh but links of 
the spirit.  
43 We are the posterity of all those who lived before us and whom we regard as models (Genesis 
18:18-19 - Ezekiel 33:23-29 - Galatians 3:6-9) and it is in this way that the Christ of God is destined 
to have children (Psalms 45:6-7,16-17). [Psalms 45 concerns Solomon but not only since a message 
that glorifies the spirit of justice is valid for all the holy prophets of God, and is more fully 
applicable to Jesus of Nazareth who is the prophet par excellence. And we can see that ordinary 
people are called gods in Psalms 82.]  
44 The cornerstone that the builders have rejected is the man Jesus. But the stumbling block and the 
rock of scandal on which many stumble and break, are entwined and caught, it is Christ Jesus the 
only begotten Son of God (1 Peter 2:6-8 - Romans 9:6-8).  
45 What is therefore asked of each one is to love and seek the truth without any idolatry in the 
heart, and to seek the general interest (either by giving one's life or by keeping it) without hating 
whoever it is otherwise one runs into the stumbling block (Leviticus 19:11-18 - Micah 6:6-8).  
46 God allows and recommends that the ten commandments be ignored to one who can expose his 
actions in a human court, without any falsification of any aspect of the facts, with the conviction of 
being recognized as being just (John 20:22-23 - 1 John 1:5-7 - Genesis 9:5).  
47 This is how Jesus sometimes speaks of himself as the only begotten Son of God (John 5:26
27,30), and it may be noted that Paul himself asks believers to apply righteousness among them (1 
Corinthians 5:1-5 - 6:1-3). 
48 Thus, all things are permitted to him who acts in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  
49 It is in the name of the only begotten Son of God that Lot has proposed to the men of his city to 
have fun with his virgin daughters rather than to kill visitors (Genesis 19:5-8).  
50 It is in the name of the only begotten Son of God that the daughters of Lot chose to give birth 
with their father rather than disappear with him in an isolated region (Genesis 19:31-32). 
51 Because he could not have the intention of liberating the Hebrew people by doing so, it is in the 
name of the only begotten Son of God that Moses has attacked a cruel Egyptian (Exodus 2:11-12).  
1647 
52 It is in the name of the only begotten Son of God that David chose to consume what the law of 
God only reserved for the priests (1 Samuel 21:3-6).  
53 This freedom to be well intentioned constitutes the message of the gospel and the substance of 
the pedagogical law of Moses (Acts 7:51 - John 1:17 - Isaiah 28:8-16). 
5 Rommel 6  
1 About the Christ of God who lives forever. 
2 Paul differentiates between the man Jesus and Christ the only begotten Son of God (Colossians 
1:15).  
3 Christ is the first creation of God, but it is only at the birth of the man Jesus that he came into the 
world. 
4 And he remained in the world after the departure of the man Jesus. 
5 He remained in the world by sitting at the right of his father, and he is by definition the holy 
command given by the man Jesus. 
6 The house of God announced by the prophet cannot be built by the hand of man (2 Samuel 7:5 - 
Isaiah 66:1-2).  
7 The house of God is built by Christ, and the house of God is the body of Christ.  
8 The body of Christ was born when the holy spirit was brought into the world after the departure of 
the man Jesus. 
9 And to this day the body of Christ is that of a child, as I exposed to the section 'Falsifications in 
the Bible' (2 Samuel 7:12-16 - Daniel 7:14,27). 
5 Rommel 7  
1 The humor of the holy scriptures.  
2 To renounce all that I possess (to be poor) means to possess only to render service to everyone in 
general and to no one in particular (Luke 6:20 - 12:33-34 - 14:33 - 4 Rommel 8:15).   
3 The believer who acts without love can crush the only begotten Son of God without touching him 
(Luke 8:43-48 - 1 Corinthians 13:3). 
4 Moreover, about the exchange between Jesus and the rich man (Luke 18:18-24), it is obvious that 
he expresses himself with mischief because he himself does not respect the ten commandments.  
5 And not only does he not respect them, but in addition he is given the mission to encourage others 
not to respect them. 
6 Indeed, he works on the sabbath which is forbidden by the fourth commandment, by asking a 
clear question to his interlocutors (Luke 6:6-11).  
1648 
7 Furthermore, he asks his interlocutors to remember that David stole (Luke 6:1-5) and this is 
forbidden by the eighth commandment.  
8 And we can remember for ourselves that David also killed (1 Samuel 17:49) and this is forbidden 
the sixth commandment.  
9 And we can also remember that Moses himself asked to kill (Exodus 21:12-14 - Deuteronomy 
19:1-6,11-13 - Numbers 35:30-31 - Deuteronomy 19:15). 
10 The Apostle Paul confirms Jesus’ sense of humor by stating that the ten commandments, which 
the man Jesus did not respect, are fulfilled by the one commandment given by the man Jesus 
(Romans 13:9-10).  
11 This complicity between Christ and his apostle also appears when the man Jesus speaks (Luke 
16:14-18).  
12 It is with mischief that he wants to signify to the greedy pharisees that they need Christ not to be 
guilty before God, in other words it is through Christ that it is possible not to respect the seventh 
commandment while being without sin before God.  
13 The usual wording being that the Lord's cross or his precious blood cleanses us from all sin.  
14 To convince oneself of this reality, it suffices to remark that Paul states that the Lord commands 
two believers who are married not to separate (1 Corinthians 7:10-11). 
15 However, he also adds that if one of the spouses behaves like a non-believer and imposes 
separation then the other spouse is no longer bonded (1 Corinthians 7:12-15) and therefore can 
remarry without offending the Lord.  
16 And after all these indirect remarks about the possibility of transgressing one of the four 
commandments of actions. 
17 For among the ten commandments, the five that concern only the thoughts and intentions must 
be rigorously respected in all circumstances, so that they determine the limits of the unique 
ambiguous commandment which is formulated with a promise because God is also the true father of 
each (2 Chronicles 15:16-17). 
18 The man Jesus asks his interlocutors whether it is possible that David was not aware of the fifth 
commandment (Luke 20:41-44).  
19 This particular humor of the man Jesus can also be seen in the Gospel of John. In fact, he first 
remarks that he came to sacrifice himself (John 4:31-34). 
20 And then he himself suggests to his interlocutors to use the law of Moses to condemn him to 
death (John 7:17-24).  
21 It is true that this excerpt can also be interpreted by saying that Jesus informs his interlocutors 
that they should not condemn him when he does not respect the fourth commandment, because they 
may find themselves in a situation where they must also disobey to this commandment. 
22 For example, when a circumcision is to be performed on the eighth day (Genesis 17:12 - 4 
Rommel 6:19). 
1649 
23 And the apostle Paul also does not lack humor (Galatians 3:27 - Romans 6:3-4 - 1 Corinthians 
15:29 - 3:18 - 2 Corinthians 12:15-16 - 1 Corinthians 9:19-23 - 1 Timothy 2:5-8).  
24 And though it is true that those who were not created in Christ by God do not have eternal life, 
he says more about the prayer (Galatians 1:15-17 - Ephesians 2:10 - 6:19-20 - Colossians 4:2-4).  
25 Like Paul, the apostle John shares the same complicity with his master when he testifies to us 
that we will be heard if we pray to God to grant eternal life to a person who has never committed 
the one unforgivable sin, as I exposed it in the section 'Figures of rhetoric, Prayer' (5 Rommel 
12:19-24).  
26 It appears that Peter is the only apostle who has remained serious (2 Peter 3:15-16). 
27 And we know, in fact, that the two epistles of Peter and the epistle of John are addressed to 
believers who already have the wisdom of the law (Galatians 2:7-10).  
28 The apostles were not saddened by the trials that life imposed on them (Acts 5:41) as they indeed 
have the right to be happy and to make known it, because they saw the first risen one who ascend to 
heaven (John 16:19-23).  
29 Thus, the man Jesus speaks mischievously because he knows that his goal is to never to commit 
sin and to be judged guilty by conservative Hebrews, and to be killed as a person who is cursed 
according to the law of Moses.  
30 And as soon as it happens, the law will become condemnable in the eyes of God who himself 
stated it by Moses. 
31 And the law will cease to be valid so that God can again judge men by their faith in God, their 
faith in truth, their faith in the justice of heart, as was the case before the arrival of Moses (John 
10:14-18 - 5 Rommel 5:33-34).  
32 Thus, all the righteous of all nations can receive the same spirit, the holy spirit, and are all equal 
before God as I have stated in the section 'Objective of the holy scriptures and the sacrifice of the 
man Jesus'.  
33 If anyone does not confess the only begotten Son of God, then he is charged with sins because he 
refuses the righteousness of the heart taught by God and he prefers either his own righteousness or 
the justice of certain men.  
34 And the righteousness of God is the resurrection of all those who died with Christ, because of the 
act of jurisprudence established by the man Jesus (John 16:7-11 - Malachi 3:6).

1 The bible is not the only way (Islam). 
2 The circumcision of the heart does not necessarily come from the knowledge of the man Jesus.  
3 The man Jesus is not the way of all the chosen of God, but the Christ the only begotten Son of 
God is the way of all the elect of God (1 Colossians 1:17 - 1 John 5:20-21).  
1650 
4 Faith is not to know the holy scriptures, but only to observe the holy commandment (1 
Thessalonians 4:3-8 - 1 Timothy 1:6-7 - Galatians 6:15 - 5:6 - 1 John 2:3-6 - 3:10).  
5 The man Jesus himself emphasized that he is not the way of all the elect (Luke 5:32 - Luke 
19:10). 
6 Thus, concerning Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, I who am not a descendant of Abraham 
according to the flesh, I do not absolutely think that the following scriptures have a negative 
connotation (Genesis 16:10-12 - 21:9-20 - Galatians 4:22-25). 
7 I say then: certainly the prophet Muhammad was sent by God who is the creator of all things, and 
who desires that Ishmael (his posterity according to the spirit, made up of all those who choose him 
as a model) serve him by a particular way. 
8 We know that the purpose of life is the circumcision of the heart therefore, necessarily but not 
with the same intensity, God uses persecution to test his elect (Genesis 15:13 - Psalms 34:17-20 - 2 
Timothy 3:12 - 1 Peter 1:6-7 - 5:6-7 - 1 John 5:19). 
9 And although ordinary humans are not born with the knowledge of the concept of justice, God the 
creator intended to lead astray those who are unjust according to their nature (2 Thessalonians 2:11
12).

1 Falsifications in the bible, first part: The new testament. 
2 If we presented a story of the future events to a scientist, he would be well inspired to check the 
correspondence between the events described and the reality of the facts before deciding on the 
plausibility of the extrasensory capacities of the author.  
3 But one would have to wonder if the story could have been altered, one way or another, before its 
transmission.  
4 We know in ourselves that a text which claims to be a word of God, the creator of all things, can 
contain no lie [and a lie is in the quality of the result that an author hopes to obtain by all the 
subtleties of the content of his message]. And this is confirmed by the apostle (1 John 2:18-21).   
5 About the epistle to the Hebrews.  
6 The writer of Hebrews teaches that Melchizedek is a living priest who lives forever.  
7 He compares Melchizedek to God by stating that he has neither father nor mother. And neither 
beginning of days nor end of life.   
8 And that Melchizedek is a priest continuously even today, and is a great man because Abraham 
gave him the tithe of the spoil and because it is unquestionably the inferior who is blessed by the 
superior. 
9 And this author says also that those who perceive the tithe instituted by the law in the old 
testament are mortal men and he writes about Melchizedek: but there, it is the one of whom it is 
attested that he is alive.  
1651 
10 No man takes this glory to himself, unless he is called by God as was Aaron. Neither did Christ 
take to himself the honor of becoming high priest, but he received it from the one who said to him: 
You are my Son, this day have I begotten you. As he says elsewhere: You are a priest forever, 
according to the order of Melchizedek (Hebrews 5:4-6).  
11 For this Melchizedek was the king of Salem, the priest of the God Most High, who met Abraham 
when he returned from the defeat of the kings and blessed him. And to whom Abraham gave tithe of 
all things. He who is first king of justice according to the meaning of his name, and then king of 
Salem namely king of peace. The one who is without father, and without mother, and without 
genealogy. He who has neither beginning of days nor end of life, but is made like the Son of God. 
This Melchizedek remains a priest in perpetuity. Now consider how great was this man to whom the 
patriarch Abraham gave a tithe of the spoils. For those of the sons of Levi who exercise the 
priesthood have, according to the law, the order to collect tithes from the people, namely from their 
brothers, although they came from the waist of Abraham. But he who did not draw his origin from 
them, took the tithe of Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. Now it is without doubt the 
lower who is blessed by the higher (Hebrews 7:1-7). 
12 And here those who receive tithes are mortal men. But there it is one of whom it is witnessed 
that he is alive. And to put it bluntly, Levi who receives the tithe paid the tithe through Abraham. 
For he was still in the waist of his father when Melchizedek went to meet Abraham (Hebrews 7:8
10). 
13 If then perfection had been possible through the Levitical priesthood, for the people received the 
law under this priesthood, why was there still necessary for another priest to appear according to the 
order of Melchizedek and not according to the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, 
there is also necessarily a change of the law. For the one about whom these things are said belongs 
to another tribe, of which no member has served at the altar. For it is well known that our Lord 
came out of Judah, a tribe of which Moses said nothing concerning the priesthood. And it becomes 
even more obvious when another priest appears in the likeness of Melchizedek, who is not made 
priest according to the law of carnal ordinance but according to the power of an imperishable life. 
For this testimony is given to him: You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek 
(Hebrews 7:11-17).  
14 I believe that the author of this epistle to the Hebrews did not understand the message of the 
gospels (Luke 9:46-48 - 22:24-27).  
15 He did not understand that Jesus is the only priest alive (John 14:6).  
16 He did not understand that Jesus is comparable to God only because he never said a lie. 
17 And he did not understand that it just means we have to get closer to Jesus only by faith in him 
(faith in the notion of love of neighbor) in the same way that Melchizedek was a priest (logically 
devoted to social work) only by faith at a time when the law of Moses was not enunciated (Psalms 
110:1-4 - Exodus 19:5-6,24-25 - Genesis 14:18-20 - And Jacob made a promise in Genesis 28:16-22 
and we must think that he fulfilled that promise since he had returned in peace to the house of his 
father according to Genesis 27:41-46 - 28:1-5 - 35:1-7,27-29). 
18 I think this author is an antichrist who wants to encourage idolatry. 
1652 
19 About the epistle of James.  
20 The author of the epistle of James suggests that it is poverty in material things that conditions 
access to eternal life.  
21 May the brother of humble condition rejoice in his elevation. And he who is rich, in his 
humiliation. For it will pass away like the flower of the grass. The sun has risen with its fiery heat 
and is withering the grass. And its flower falls, and the beauty of its appearance is gone. Likewise 
the rich withers in his way (James 1:9-11). Listen, my beloved brothers. Has not God chosen the 
poor in the eyes of the world, so that they may be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he 
promised to those who love him? But you have despised the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you 
and bring you to court? Are they not the ones who insult the honorable name by which you are 
called? (James 2:5-7). 
22 And this is completely false (1 Thimothy 6:17-19 - Luke 19:1-10). 
23 He also suggests that faith, and not repentance for sinful behavior, should be practiced in 
mourning and tears. 
24 Feel your misery, and be in mourning and tears. Let your laughter turn into mourning, and your 
joy into sadness. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you (James 4:9-10). 
25 Yet the characteristics of faith imply that we must rejoice in hope and be patient in affliction 
(Philippians 4:4 - 1 Pierre 3:15-16 - 5:10). 
26 He also teaches that a sick person will obtain healing and forgiveness for his sins by calling on 
the elders of the church to pray and perform rituals provided that trust of the sick person is total in 
this action of the elders of the church.  
27 Is anyone among you sick. Let him call the elders of the Church and let these elders pray for him 
and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the 
Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him. Therefore confess 
your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. For the fervent prayer 
of a righteous man is very useful (James 5:14-16). If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask God who 
gives to all simply and without reproach. And it will be given to him. But let him ask in faith and 
without doubting. For he who doubts is like the wave of the sea, tossed by the wind and driven from 
side to side. Let not such a man imagine that he will receive anything from the Lord (James 1:5-7). 
28 This author is a true antichrist (Exodus 20:3 - Luke 16:16). 
29 The first commandment simply indicates that one must beware of any kind of idolatry since in 
reality there is only one God who is God is by his nature. And in any case, prayer only serves to 
strengthen the one who prays, as I will expose it in the section 'Figures of rhetoric, Prayer'.  
30 About the epistle of Jude.  
31 The author asks us to hate those who are against our opinions, to hate even the tunic soiled by 
their flesh.  
1653 
32 Have compassion for some, by making a difference. And save others by pulling them from the 
fire. And for others, have mercy mixed with fear, even hating the tunic soiled by the flesh (Jude 22
23).  
33 He is an antichrist because he moves away from the definition of the christian faith (2 Peter 1:5
10) and the implications of this definition (Titus 3:1-3 - 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15 - Luke 6:27-29).  
34 About the second and third epistles John.  
35 The author asks not to greet a person who is winding toward us with a different speech, and he 
adds that he does not want to expose the very useful things he has to convey, and he prefers speak 
mouth to mouth so that his joy is perfect. 
36 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house or 
greet him. For whoever greets him participates in his evil works. Although I have many things to 
write to you, I did not want to do it with paper and ink. But I hope to come to you and speak face to 
face so that our joy may be complete. The children of your chosen sister salute you (2 John 10-13).  
37 His goal, therefore, is not to explain the message of the gospel to everyone by testifying of what 
he has lived with the man Jesus.  
38 He also suggests that faith consists in not sharing anything with the Gentiles.  
39 For it was in the name of Jesus Christ that they went without receiving anything from the 
pagans. We must therefore welcome such men, in order to be workers with them for the truth (3 
John 7-8).  
40 And yet it is not for us to know who will be called by God and when.  
41 About the book of the Revelation of John.  
42 The one who said that he is coming back into the world, he is the first born of creation who came 
into the world in the form of the man Jesus and who dwells in the world sitting at the right hand of 
his father. 
43 He is neither the all-powerful nor the last.  
44 Behold he comes with the clouds. And every eye will see him, and those who pierced him. And 
all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of him. Yes. Amen. I am the Alpha and the Omega, 
says the Lord. The one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty (Revelation 1:7-8). 
Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to render to every man according to his work. I 
am the alpha and the omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end (Revelation 22:12-13). 
45 This author is an antichrist who wants the reader not to understand the scriptures of the gospels 
and apostles who make a clear distinction between God the Father and his only begotten Son, and 
also the scriptures of the prophet who say different things about the only begotten Son of God 
(Isaiah 28:16) and about God the Father (Isaiah 41:4 - 44:6 - 48:12).

1 Falsifications in the Bible, second part: The old testament.  
1654 
2 As I pointed out in the section 'The identity of God', the chronology that is exposed in the 
revelations of the holy spirit is not conceived from a human perspective. 
3 And it may be thought that until today the body of Christ is that of a child who does not know 
how to reject the evil and choose the good. 
4 For the holy writings still contain serious falsifications which I have highlighted previously, but 
not only.  
5 Indeed, the interpretation of the events described in the prophecies is not necessarily trivial (Isaiah 
7:13-15 - 2 Peter 1:20-21). 
6 Like the gospel, the old testament scriptures are not necessarily spared by the enemies of God.  
7 Indeed, in some ancient translations of the Bible, the scripture Isaiah 7:14 contains the expression 
'a virgin shall conceive', as is the case in the translation King James Version (KJV). 
8 And in other translations more recent, this expression has become 'the young woman will become 
pregnant', as is the case with the translation Complete Jewish Bible (CJB).  
9 Whatever the reality, any falsifications in the old testament cannot call into question the message 
of the gospel, as I pointed out in the section 'Objective of the holy scriptures and the sacrifice of the 
man Jesus'.  
10 However, I want to emphasize that the authors of such a practice, if it were done on purpose, 
would be really foolish because by acting in this way, they would deny the kind that was 
distinguished by the holy writings of which they had been the guardians.  
11 Because the God by whom they received this distinction told them that he is righteous and just, 
and that he chose them to be like him.  
12 Did I not write in the 'Overview' section that faith is about trusting no one.

1 Comments on the epistles of the apostles and the gospels, first part: Falsifications. 
2 The current contents of the Gospels have not always been as we see it.  
3 Over time, men's organizations have approved additions of different verses to the original version 
of the texts written in the language of the people that the man Jesus came to release (funny).  
4 For example, we know that Matthew 17:21 which is absent from the American Standard Version 
(ASV) and which is similar to Mark 9:29, was not present in the first translations. 
5 But this kind of demon only comes out through prayer and fasting (Matthew 17:21). He said to 
them: This species can only come out through prayer (Mark 9:29). 
6 This is also the case of Mark 16:16-20.  
7 He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 
And these are the miracles that will accompany those who believe. In my name they will cast out 
1655 
demons, and they will speak new languages. And they will seize serpents, and if they drink any 
deadly drink then it will not harm them. And they will lay hands on the sick, and the sick will be 
healed. So after the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right 
hand of God. And they went and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and 
confirmed the word by the miracles that accompanied it (Mark 16:16-20).  
8 And although the action described is confirmed by Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, we know that 
this is also the case of Luke 22:19-20,43-44.  
9 And also John 5:4 which is absent from ASV. [But it is the only possible explanation of John 5:7]  
10 And also John 7:53. 
11 And also John 8:1-11. But I also think, like others, that this particular excerpt could really have 
happened. 
12 And on my own initiative, I state that this is probably the case of Matthew 15:28 - 28:19. 
13 Then Jesus answered and said to her: O woman, great is your faith. Let it be done to you as you 
wish. And her daughter was healed at that same hour (Matthew 15:28). 
14 Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son 
and of the holy spirit. 
15 Now, we know that any self-respecting falsifier must seek to confuse the tracks. 
16 And I state that in my opinion, the Gospels of Luke and John are necessary and sufficient (after 
removing the verses I mentioned above) for one who wants to be interested in the words of the man 
Jesus.  
17 The New Testament canon from which I built my understanding of the christian faith consists of 
the following nineteen books: Gospel of Luke, and Gospel of John, and the Acts of the Apostles, 
and Paul(13), and Peter(2), and First John. 
5 Rommel 12  
1 Comments on the epistles of the apostles and the gospels, second part: Figures of rhetoric, Prayer. 
2 In each book of the new testament, different verses do not have the meaning that suits them when 
considered in isolation. And it is essential to be interested in the harmony of all the writings of the 
same author, at least the same book, before extracting a true message.  
3 Subdividing the scriptures into different verses is therefore a practical idea for making quotations, 
but can become a trap if it is not used conscientiously.  
4 Because of this, the introduction of some falsified verses into one of these books may be enough 
to distract the reader from the path to follow, and even suggest to people who have the common 
sense notion inscribed in their hearts that the scriptures cannot be holy. 
5 The prayer of the believer is good and necessary, but its only usefulness, and in no way a 
negligible cause, is to strengthen the faith of the one who prays.  
1656 
6 It is to strengthen the one who prays. For the scriptures tell us that everything is written in 
advance (Isaiah 43:5-7).  
7 And if anyone understands through his faith in the scriptures that everything is written in advance, 
then all he has left to do is to have faith possibly accompanied by hymns and praises for the creator 
(1 Timothy 1:5).  
8 And Peter defines faith only by its characteristics (2 Peter 1:5-8).  
9 It seems unlikely to me that a non-believer can understand that everything is written in advance 
(Luke 18:17). 
10 About the prayer in Luke's gospel. 
11 Luke informs us that the only purpose of prayer is to give the believer the strength not to 
transgress the only commandment that constitutes faith (Luke 22:40 - 21:34-36 - 11:1-4).  
12 In addition, we know that some believers will suffer because of their faith, and some will lose 
the life of their carnal envelopes because of that same faith (Luke 21:16-19).  
13 Now it is evident that he who has had faith by the knowledge of the scriptures cannot hope that 
the promises do not happen, because he expects the next life which is also a promise. 
14 Therefore, with regard to what we can honestly ask in our prayers we must think that it is only 
about the holy spirit (Luke 11:13). 
15 Moreover, since the holy spirit is in the world, the time of the prophets who approached God by 
prayer is past (Luke 16:16). 
16 About the prayer in John's gospel. 
17 We know that we should not trust a man (Jeremiah 17:5). As a result, the man Jesus speaks of 
himself only as the only begotten son of God when he says we will be listened to if we ask anything 
in his name (John 14:14-15 - 16:23-24).  
18 Because we cannot wish him to become a liar, the utility of prayer becomes clear to us when we 
understand that we cannot ask, in the name of the only begotten Son of God, that they do not occur 
in our lives the events that he himself has foretold (John 16:1-4). 
19 About the prayer in the first epistle of John. 
20 John confirms to us that not all have eternal life (4 Rommel 4:3-4), as it has already been 
established by God, and he recommends us to pray for God to give life (4 Rommel 11:23) to every 
person (1 John 2:19 - 5:14-17).  
21 We then understand that the goal is to help the believer not to hate those who have not yet 
understood, in other words not to compromise oneself in the faith because it is not the actions of 
others that must determine our state before God. Let us not forget the purpose of life. 
22 One might ask, however, why the only prayer that is forbidden is to ask God to have compassion 
for a person who has abandoned the faith (Luke 12:10 - 2 Peter 2:20-21), assuming that this person 
has already truly known the faith.  
1657 
23 The answer is that it could destroy our own faith if we imagined that it is possible for us to 
extinguish for a short time the spirit of God who is in us, with the intention of rekindling it later.  
24 Adultery to God is indeed unforgivable (Acts 5:1-6,7-11 - 1 Samuel 2:25). 
25 About the prayer in Peter's letters. 
26 Peter states that faith has priority over prayer (1 Peter 4:7-8). 
27 About prayer in Paul's letters. 
28 As I explained in the section 'The Humor of the Scriptures', Paul generally speaks indirectly, 
having himself repeatedly stated that he is speaking primarily to the Gentiles, although God make 
no distinction between men since his only begotten Son is seated at his right according to the gospel 
which was entrusted to Paul (1 Peter 1:17 - Colossians 3:24-25 - 1 Timothy 1:11 - Galatians 2:7-8).  
29 Knowing that he cannot contradict the other apostles and gospels, it can be seen that this is 
indeed the case (Ephesians 6:18 - Romans 8:26-27). 
5 Rommel 13  
1 Comments on the epistles of the apostles and the gospels, third part: Features of books. 
2 About Peter's letters. 
3 It seems to me that Peter speaks mainly of the man Jesus whom he also calls Christ, and this is in 
no way a fault because of the principle of the second trinity. 
4 And he sometimes refers to Christ in two forms (to the man and the only begotten Son) in the 
same sentence.  
5 But there are cases where he refers only to the only begotten Son of God, sometimes by 
designating him otherwise (Lord, shepherd, bishop) as in 1 Peter 2:25. 
6 About Paul's letters. 
7 As I explained in the section 'The Humor of the Scriptures', Paul expresses himself in a particular 
way to a particular audience.  
8 Paul was for the Gentiles what Moses was for the Hebrews, a guardian to teach the beginning of 
wisdom, that one might understand what is meant by the righteousness of the heart which is 
pleasing to God (4 Rommel 6:29-30 - 7:18-19 - 12:62-65 - Deuteronomy 4:1-6,7-8 - 3 Rommel 
1:54).  
9 But since the elect of God are one people since his only begotten Son sits at his right hand, it is 
fitting to say that Paul gave the milk to the body of Christ, who must then grow on his own and 
learn to choose good and to reject evil, as I point out in the section 'Falsifications in the Bible'.  
10 All is permitted to him who acts in the name of the only begotten Son of God, but it is not 
necessary to say it brutally to a child (1 Corinthians 3:1-2). 
11 About the letter of John. 
1658 
12 In his first letter John, I think the word Jesus refers to the man Jesus in a single verse (1 John 
1:7) and everywhere else in his text, 'Jesus' or 'Jesus Christ' refers to Christ who is the only begotten 
Son of God and who remained in the world after the departure of the man Jesus.  
13 Regarding the confession of sins, it is to those to whom we have wronged that we must confess 
our sin when it is necessary for the good of all. 
14 About the Gospel of John. 
15 Different verses are stated in a subtle way but are necessarily non-contradictory in a correct 
interpretation.  
16 So the conditions set out for accessing eternal life (John 3:16 - 6:47) should not be interpreted 
naively (John 6:53-56 - 13:34-35 - 14:15 - 4 Rommel 6:21). 
17 About the Gospel of Luke. 
18 It is necessary to love everyone and trust only in God (Luke 12). 
5 Rommel 14  
1 The gift of tongues by the holy spirit. 
2 If I speak in a language that does not exist, how is it a miracle. 
3 Does speaking in tongue mean to express oneself in a language that does not exist among men, or 
does it mean to express oneself in a language that has not been learned but that is already used by 
certain groups of people (Acts 2:8-11). 
4 One can wonder if each spectator heard in his native tongue the words of every apostle. Or if each 
apostle spoke in one language which was the mother tongue of a part of the audience. Or if each 
apostle was speaking in different languages, and each time it was the mother tongue of a part of the 
audience. Or if it was only the spectators with the gift of listening who understand the meaning of 
the words of each apostle (1 Corinthians 14:23 - Acts 2:4-8). 
5 On the other hand, one may wonder if the apostle Paul is referring to the gift of interpretation of 
languages that do not exist (they are not usually used by any group of men). Or if the apostle Paul is 
referring to the gift of interpretation of dreams. Or if the apostle Paul is referring to the gift of 
interpretation of languages that have not been learned but are already used by certain people (1 
Corinthians 12:30 - 14:5,26).  
6 On the other hand, Paul himself cannot claim that the tongues of angels will cease since his 
teaching is precisely that we will become like angels when we leave this world.  
7 Let us not forget that figures of rhetoric are a specialty of the Gospels and apostles (1 Corinthians 
12:10 - 13:1,8-10 - 14:2). 
8 Finally, we understand that Paul (1 Corinthians 13:1-2) and consequently Jesus also (Luke 17:6) 
are using hyperboles. 
1659 
9 Because to be loved by God it is necessary and sufficient to be inhabited by the notion of 'relative 
truth' which is the hallmark of God (1 John 4:7-8). 
10 And which is only recognizable by the love of the general interest namely his only begotten Son 
(John 10:30). 
11 And this characteristic of God is found in a small proportion in every 'child of God' and in an 
incomparable quantity in Jesus of Nazareth.

3 If we existed before the formation of the world (Job 38:1-4) then how coexist the physical world 
and that of the spirits (2 Kings 2:9-11 - 6:15-17 - Ezekiel 40:1-4 - Luke 9:28-34 - 2 Corinthians 
12:2-4). 
4 And can a spirit be born again into the world without being aware of it (Malachi 4:4-6 - Luke 
1:13-17 - John 1:19-36). 
5 Can a human spirit inhabit any other animal (Luke 8:26-35 - Genesis 9:5). 
6 The children of angels. 
7 How can a spirit procreate with a man’s daughter (Genesis 6:1-4 - Luke 1:35). 
8 The second coming. 
9 On the one hand we expect a final resurrection (Daniel 12:1-2 - John 5:28-29 - 6:40-47). 
10 And on the other hand those who believe in him never die (John 11:25-27 - Luke 23:43).  
11 I think that from the moment when the only begotten Son of God sits at the right hand of his 
father, all those who die with the circumcised heart access directly to heaven by becoming sons of 
God, before the second coming which will concern the world as a whole, the rest of souls (1 
Corinthians 15:51-53 - 1 Thessalonians 4:14-17).
