1 General preface, second part: My Prophet My Honor. 
2 Moses is said to have written the Jewish law (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, 
Deuteronomy) possibly partly through a servant such as Joshua (Exodus 4:10-16 - 6:10-12,28-30 - 
33:7-11), part of the end of Deuteronomy having been added by his servant Joshua.  
3 But it is possible that the present form of these books and the end of Deuteronomy is a later work 
done by some prophets (Exodus 16:32-34 - 17:13-14 - 24:1-4,5-7 - Deuteronomy 31:24-26 - Joshua 
1:8 - 2 Kings 22:8-16 - 23:24 - 2 Chronicles 34:14-24).  
4 For a book transmits information whose meaning needs to be clarified when the language used 
undergoes structural changes and vocabulary enrichment over the centuries. When the vocabulary is 
poor, different situations are described by identical words and the meaning depends on the context.  
5 For examples, the word earth can refer indifferently to dust or a particular ground or the entire 
planet. And the word man or the pronoun he can either designate a male human specifically, or 
designate any human more generally and this aspect is retained in this work for the sake of brevity.  
6 The notion of context is necessary even with current vocabulary. The verb lie can be used to 
indicate the fact of not telling the truth, but also the continuance of a state, or the fact of placing 
oneself in a position of rest, and in the latter possibility the past tense of lie is lay. And lay is a verb 
used in the present tense to mean put something down. We can also think of the word lead which is 
a verb synonymous with guide, but also the name of a heavy metal. Moreover, it seems natural to 
state that the house of Yahweh is the structure formed by the holy place and the most holy place, 
36 
and that the temple of Yahweh or the sanctuary is the whole structure containing this house, and the 
inner courtyard where there is the altar of burnt offerings, and the outer courtyard. But in the texts 
the word temple sometimes designates only the house of Yahweh to which one can add the 
numerous rooms which are adjacent to the holy place and the most holy place [but these rooms do 
not exist in the tabernacle described and built by Moses], and sometimes this word temple 
designates only the holy place, and sometimes the word house designates the whole structure which 
includes the courtyards. And there is a similar nuance with the word tabernacle and the word 
sanctuary. And the meaning of the same statement by Jesus may depend on the people to whom he 
gives this information (John 8:21-22 - 13:33-36), and a same sentence does not necessarily have the 
same meaning when it is said by two different persons since one can think that Abraham was not 
doubting unlike Sarah (Genesis 17:15-18 - 18:9-14 - Romans 4:19-22). 
7 And the expression 'same time' could previously be used to designate a temporal proximity during 
which major events of a very different nature from those mentioned did not happen. And the word 
day, depending on the context of its use, could refer to a period of time separated by significant 
events (Isaiah 7:17-25 - Deuteronomy 1:1-3,4-5 - 9:1 - 34:7-8 - Joshua 3:1-2,3-4). And we notice 
that for the feasts instituted in the scriptures, a day of celebration takes place between two 
successive sunsets (Exodus 12:14-19). And this is not what we naturally think with the 
contemporary vocabulary in which a day takes place between a sunrise and the next sunset. And it 
appears that the words 'forever' and 'perpetual' and 'everlasting' have sometimes been used to 
indicate only a long period of time, possibly subject to the fulfillment of certain constraints which 
are not explicitly specified (1 Samuel 2:30 - Jeremiah 25:9-12). But it may also happen that these 
words are used with their fundamental meanings but must be understood as applying to the legacies 
of certain people in particular without this affecting the legacies of their descendants according to 
the flesh (Jeremiah 20:10-11 - 23:39-40).  
8 Furthermore, there appears to be a rule of increasing by one year in the time of the kings of Israel 
based on the exact numbers of months when the durations are counted in years (2 Kings 8:25 - 9:29 - 18:1,9-10 - Jeremiah 25:1-3 - 32:1-2 - 2 Kings 22:1 - 23:31,36 - 24:8-12 - 25:1-2). And Job says 
that he has been righteous for as long as he can remember (Job 10:1-2 - 27:1-7), but he also 
recognizes that an ordinary person cannot have been completely righteous from birth (Job 13:26 - 
14:4). And David said that he has nothing to reproach himself for (2 Samuel 22:1-2,22-24) but this 
is true only because he has already confessed his only recognized transgression (1 Kings 15:5) [and 
in addition, the punishment was indicated to him]. Moreover, 'fall on one's face' can simply mean to 
kneel and look at the ground and thus it is still possible to bow down after that (1 Samuel 20:41 - 
25:23 - 2 Samuel 9:6 - 14:22).  
9 Also, it is unlikely that a whole community of men used to drink water by using their tongues as a 
real dog will do when he drinks water [I refuse to believe it until the proof of the contrary, it is very 
hard to believe]. That is why we must give a meaning to Judges 7:5-7 of which the best known 
version is the following: Then he brought the people down to the water, and Yahweh said to Gideon: 
He who licks the water with his tongue as a dog licks, you will set apart. And the same is true for all 
those who kneel down to drink. And the number of those who licked by putting their hands to their 
mouths was three hundred men. And all the other people bowed down on their knees to drink water. 
37 
And Yahweh said to Gideon: It is by the three hundred men who licked that I will save you, and I 
will deliver the Midianites into your hand. And let all the other people go, each in his place.  
10 Moses is said also to have written the book of Job using sources not all specified, the main one 
being the spirit of God.  
11 Joshua is said to have written the book that bears his name, whose final form may have been 
established at the time of Samuel (Joshua 10:14 - 15:63 - 16:10 - 24:26-27).  
12 Samuel is said to have written the book of Judges (Joshua 10:12-13 - 1 Samuel 10:25 - 2 Samuel 
1:17-18), and that of Ruth, and part of the book which bears his name and which was completed by 
prophets such as Gad and Nathan mentioned there. 
13 Jeremiah is said to have written the book of Kings using sources not all specified and some of 
which are mentioned in the same book, and the book of Lamentations, and the book that bears his 
name (Jeremiah 36:1-4).  
14 Ezra is said to have written the book of Chronicles using sources not all specified and some of 
which are mentioned in the same book, and also the book that bears his name, the harmonization of 
the stories in the latter having possibly been carried out by another prophet. 
15 Nehemiah is said to have written the book that bears his name. 
16 The main contributor to the book of Esther is said to be Mordecai, but the story was harmonized 
by other prophets.  
17 The main contributor to the book of Psalms is king David but some texts are not his as is often 
mentioned in the introductions.  
18 King Solomon is said to be the main contributor to the book of Proverbs, and would have written 
that of Ecclesiastes and that of the Song of songs.  
19 Isaiah is said to be the main contributor to the book that bears his name.  
20 Ezekiel is said to have written the book that bears his name and to which a few lines introduction 
was added.  
21 Each of the nine minor prophets is said to be the main contributor to the book that bears his 
name. [I have deleted three of the twelve who are usually named, because their writings do not 
make me feel the subtlety of the holy spirit.] 
22 And the list of books which constitute the Hebrew Bible was stated by a community of prophets 
several centuries before Jesus Christ.  
23 And the evangelist Luke is said to have written the gospel of Jesus Christ using different sources 
(Luke 1:1-4), and he is also said to have written the book of Acts of the apostles (Acts 1:1-3).  
24 The apostle John is said to have completed the gospel of Luke with his version of the facts (John 
21:20-25), according to his memories. And he is said also to have written the letter first John. [Now 
John 1:35-39,40-42 occurred before Luke 5:1-11, and Luke 10:38-42 occurred before John 11:1, 
and the content of John 11:2 does not refer to Luke 7:36-39 but rather to John 12:1-7, and John 
2:12-21 occurred before Luke 19:36-48.] 
38 
25 The Apostle Paul is the author of thirteen letters which are addressed each time to specific 
communities, according to the particularities of the receivers. These letters being however intended 
to instruct the whole humanity.  
26 The apostle Peter is said to have written two letters as a witness to the teachings of Jesus Christ 
(1 Peter 5:12 - 2 Peter 1:16-19). 
27 And I wrote the commentary on the Bible that is attached to this work and is structured in five 
letters. 
28 For when one read the holy scriptures without guidance, one may be tempted to adopt strange 
behaviors such as standing before a young tree and saying with great faith, Uproot yourself, uproot 
yourself (Luke 17:5-6). And I myself had this particular behavior after a first reading of the gospels. 
It is not abnormal to behave strangely when you are ignorant.
