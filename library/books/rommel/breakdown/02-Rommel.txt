2 Rommel 
1 Preface to Hebrew Bible: Men of honor Men of valor, a somewhat abstract notion for the simple 
minded. 
2 It is logical to appropriate the fruit of one's own labor (Genesis 15:13-16 - Exodus 12:35-41) but it 
is not holy to covet what belongs to others (1 Samuel 15:1-11 - Esther 9:5-10,15-16). 
3 This is why Jonathan is not guilty (1 Samuel 14:24-27) since he acted without having been aware 
of the instructions given by the king, but this same Jonathan is wrong in his thinking (1 Samuel 
14:30 - Joshua 5:10-12 - Judges 9:45). No ordinary living being is perfect, not even Jonathan.  
4 No willful transgression that cannot be justified by any circumstantial constraint is forgivable 
(Numbers 15:29-31). However, among transgressions that do not very directly offend another 
human being, what should not occur in ideal situations (Exodus 22:31 - Deuteronomy 14:21 - 
Leviticus 17:10-14) may occur in particular contexts (Leviticus 17:15-16 - 22:10-14 - 1 Samuel 
14:23-24,31-35).  
5 However the members of the tribe of Levi are theoretically the only ones authorized to offer 
sacrifices to Yahweh in the name of the law of Moses (2 Chronicles 11:1-12,13-17). That is why 
Saul is personally wrong to decide for himself to gather the army by making such an offering (1 
Samuel 10:7 - 12:19-25 - 13:8-14). For if Samuel had this behavior previously (1 Samuel 7:7-10), it 
is because he speaks directly with Yahweh without the intermediary of a Levite priest or another 
prophet (1 Samuel 3:19-21 - 9:14-20). And Saul cannot say the same even if he can sometimes have 
dreams (1 Samuel 14:1-3,17-19,36-37 - 28:6,15), and this particular offering on a battlefield is not 
even commanded by the law of Moses [It was a personal initiative of Samuel which came from the 
59 
depths of his heart according to the imperfect knowledge that he had of the exact identity of 
Yahweh].  
6 The notion of purpose in life has always been completely individual however, because each being 
is mathematically and physically connected to the totality of its achievements in the world (Exodus 
21:1-4 - Deuteronomy 7:25-26 - Judges 8:22-28 - Luke 20:20-26,41-44 - 4 Rommel 6:11-12), our 
behavior can influence the trials suffered by our descendants for several generations.  
7 Not all the enemies of Israel were declared particularly cursed since some were simply punished 
for a direct guilt towards Israel (Numbers 31:1-2,48-54 - 3 Rommel 1:21). And cursed precious 
objects are not to be used by the people (Deuteronomy 7:25-26) but they can be preserved in what 
temporarily represents the dwelling place of the one who created all things and who curses that 
which is worth being cursed (Joshua 6:17-24 - 7:1-26). This is not so surprising since the very 
notion of a dwelling of God which is possibly built by the hand of man can have a pedagogical 
utility in particular contexts [as a preferable place for the teaching of the exact knowledge of God 
and the purpose of life] but over a long period it is something cursed because it becomes a source of 
idolatry.  
8 The notion of responsibility that connects each being to its achievements (Zechariah 5:1-4 - 4 
Rommel 12:53-56) allows the free use of different names to designate the author of a single 
achievement (Leviticus 22:24-25 - 4 Rommel 11:14-15 - 2 Samuel 6:17-19 - 2 Chronicles 1:6 - 
Leviticus 1 - because the law of Moses was applied by these persons - 1 Kings 8:55-58 - 1 
Chronicles 15:11-14 - Ezekiel 45:22 - 46:2). It was the people who acted but under the direction of 
Joshua, and it was God who ordered the action and named the targets but initially through Moses 
(Joshua 1:1-9 - 11:12,15). We can also notice that the descendants of Ephraim are obsessed with the 
desire to actively participate in historical events (Judges 8:1-3 - 12:1-6 - 2 Samuel 19:40-43). 
Furthermore, the verb anoint can be used to designate only a link of responsibility (4 Rommel 7:20 - 
11:16) as in the reference 1 Kings 19:15-18. For the prophet Elijah only chose his successor Elisha 
(1 Kings 19:19-21), and it was Elisha who directly informed Hazael that he will be king of Syria (2 
Kings 8:7-13,14-15), and it was Elisha who indirectly had Jehu anointed to be king of Israel (2 
Kings 9:1-3 - 2 Chronicles 22:7).   
9 In order to teach humans to build a preferable place in eternity, possibly anonymously, different 
communities have received various revelations but a very ancient people, destined to disappear due 
to the beliefs which structure their existence, has kept an instructive story. This is the Hebrew Bible 
summarized in the following prayer.  
10 Our God, creator of heaven and earth and only true God of the universe (Psalms 83 - Jonah 1:9), 
you have chosen us from among all communities to constitute thirteen distinct tribes (Genesis 48 - 
49) in order to enlighten humanity (Deuteronomy 4 - Numbers 36). And this must last at least a 
thousand generations (1 Chronicles 16:15-18), that is to say between five thousand years and twenty 
five thousand years depending on what we can consider to be the average gap between two 
generations.  
11 We have not always been obedient to the commandments that you gave us through our parents 
and therefore you have scattered us among different other peoples who do not know you (2 Kings 
17:1-23 - 24:8-20 - 25:1-12 - 1 Chronicles 5:18-26 - 2 Kings 15:29).  
60 
12 We want to come back to you and serve you (Leviticus 13:40-45 - 14:34-47 - 21:16-24 - 23:34
38,39-44 - Numbers 5:17 - 6:1-8,9-12,13-18 - 10:1-10 - 15:37-41 - Deuteronomy 16:1-3 - 24:8 - 
Exodus 31:12-18 - Numbers 9:1-14 - 2 Chronicles 30:1-3,13-21,22-27 - John 4:22). 
13 We know that you love two things, and that there are three that glorify you: The magnificent 
house that we are to build so that you may dwell in it, and the feast of tabernacles, and the sabbath 
day (Ezra 3:6-13 - 4:1-24 - 5:1-17 - 6:1-14 - Haggai 1:5-9 - Zechariah 14:16-21 - 1 Rommel 3:35 - 
Leviticus 23:3 - John 8:23-24 - 15:22-27 - 4 Rommel 6:2-3).  
14 For we must identify all our brothers and sisters if we are to properly serve our God (Leviticus 
25:38-55 - Ezra 2:59-63). We must not prostitute our souls as the false Jews who had been brought 
in a part of the promised land did (2 Kings 17:24-41 - 1 Kings 8:20-21 - 2 Chronicles 6:10-11 - 
Jeremiah 7:21-24).  
15 It is not only through the knowledge of the message of a certain Jesus Christ that we may 
continually remember that a people of God was brought out of Egypt. For we absolutely must 
remember it by practicing exactly the totality of what was transmitted to Moses our great master 
(Deuteronomy 6:20-25 - 1 Kings 8:55-58). If honor had a face then its name would be Jewish Soul 
(Job 28 - But it is true that Job did not belong to the twelve tribes of Israel - 3 Rommel 1:27). 
16 Stretch out your mighty arm to support our unknown brothers and sisters who are scattered 
among humanity, act in due time to bring them home, and build the walls of Jerusalem (Isaiah 2 - 
Micah 4).  
17 We wish that each community that existed before could continue forever with its own traditions 
(Exodus 28:9-21,29-38 - 29:29-30,38-46 - Deuteronomy 13:1-11 - Psalms 119:135-142 - John 1:17
18 - 10:17-18).  
18 We know within ourselves that we are not the descendants of people who converted to judaism 
in the past (Numbers 15:13-16 - Isaiah 56:1-9 - Esther 8:17). This written heritage belongs to us 
because it has been transmitted to us. And there are many instances of deception in our holy 
scriptures, and we read and we practice, and we do nothing more and nothing less.  
19 We love the word of our God and the word of our God is the truth. It is our own nature within us, 
deep inside the inner part of ourselves (Job 37:1). Lord, take possession of your people because it is 
not so much about what we do but about what we are and what we deserve. 
20 We have a pretty clear line of conduct concerning the true children of Jacob who would dare to 
claim that all men are loved by God in the same way (Deuteronomy 13:12-18). Lord we will never 
forget.  
21 And for those of you who speak of a certain legend concerning a Jesus of Nazareth that neither 
you nor we actually knew.  
22 You must understand that our God was angry because the corpses of kings touched his house 
(Jonah 3 - Haggai 2:10-13 - Ezekiel 43:7-12 - 2 Chronicles 13:1-22 - 14:1-7 - 1 Kings 15:1-4,8-12 - 
Psalms 50 - Amos 5–8 - Zechariah 7:1-14 - 8:16-17 - Jeremiah 4:1-4,5-10 - 5:23-31 - 7:1-15,16-34 - 
8:4-9 - 9:1-9 - 21:1-10,11-14 - Isaiah 28:1-7 - Proverbs 6:12-19). When we will have built for him a 
magnificent place that is worthy of his greatness, then we will protect that place with all our 
61 
strength (1 Kings 14:25-28). For we have received this instruction: No foreigner who is both 
uncircumcised in flesh and uncircumcised in heart will approach it (Ezekiel 44:4-16). [Now Ezekiel 
used to fall on his face when he saw the glory of Yahweh and not when he saw the temple of 
Yahweh (Ezekiel 1:28 - 3:23 - 43:3 - 44:4), as it was already the case with those who lived before 
him (Exodus 33:8-10 - 1 Chronicles 29:20 - 2 Chronicles 7:1-3) and as it was the case with those 
who lived after him (Nehemiah 8:4-6). And king Solomon had not prayed toward the holy place or 
the most holy place of the new house where he had just set up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh (1 
Kings 3:1-5,15 - 8:1-13 - 2 Chronicles 1:1-7 - 5:1-10,11-14 - 6:1-3), but rather toward heaven (1 
Kings 8:54-56 - 2 Chronicles 2:4-6 - 6:10-14). Therefore the fact that the people must position 
themselves at a special place in the house of Yahweh in order to worship Yahweh is an innovation 
planned for the temple of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 46:1-3). For Ezekiel makes us understand that the Jews 
are convinced that the glory of Yahweh walks on earth and then comes to live in the most holy place 
of the temple which is built in their territory (Exodus 19:9,17 - 24:9-12 - 29:38-42,43-46 - Ezekiel 
1:1-28 - 3:14-15,22-24 - 8:1-4,5-6 - 10:1-4,15-22 - 11:1-13,22-25 - 40:1-5 - 43:1-4,5-12 - 44:1-5 - 
48:29-35 - 1 Kings 8:9 - 2 Chronicles 5:10 - Numbers 10:29-33 - Haggai 1:12-15 - 2:1-5,10-15,20
23 - Zechariah 2:10-13 - 8:1-3 - 3 Rommel 1:2 - 5 Rommel 5:10-12 - John 10:30-31 - Acts 7:46
54,55-60 - 1 Rommel 3:35).]  
23 Now they say that this house which is necessary to perform the service requested by our God 
(Ezekiel 44:17-31) will never exist with all the laws of its functioning that have been clearly 
specified by the prophet (Ezekiel 46:8-10 - 48:29-35 - John 4:22) and which are in contradiction 
with those of Moses (4 Rommel 13). But if this Jesus of Nazareth is God because his body is the 
temple of God, then how can we explain that he could have had brothers and sisters (Luke 1:30-35 - 
8:19-21). For Ezekiel the prophet said the following thing about the angel (3 Rommel 1:2 - Ezekiel 
40:1-2,3-5 - 43:1-4,5-7) who had spoken to him: Then he brought me back by the way of the outer 
gate of the sanctuary that looks toward the east, and it was closed. And Yahweh said to me: This 
gate will stay shut. It will not be opened, and no man will enter through it, because Yahweh, the 
God of Israel, has entered through it. Therefore it will stay shut (Ezekiel 44:1-2). [Now this vision 
of Ezekiel takes place while the people are in captivity and is supposed to be fulfilled later in the 
future, in the same way that his vision of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple of Yahweh 
had occurred five years before its fulfillment in Ezekiel 8:1-4,5-6 - 9:1-11 - 11:22-25 - 24:1-2 - 
33:21-29.] 
24 In his anger at our stiff necks [or more precisely his pain not only because it is useless and 
inappropriate to be funny when one wants to instruct others on a serious subject, but also because 
there is nothing funny when one only wants the receiver of the message to understand his mistake 
by himself and repent (Jeremiah 31:31-34 - Ezekiel 44:19 - 46:20 - Haggai 2:1-5,6-9,10-13). For 
one cannot sincerely repent of a fault with a smile], our God cannot have had the sole purpose of 
making us think deeply about the logic that introduced the notion of a house of God (1 Rommel 
3:16 - Exodus 25:10-16,17-22 - Numbers 7:89 - 1 Kings 8:9) and the distribution of roles to its 
occupants (Ezekiel 44:10-16 - 48:8-13 - 1 Rommel 3:11-12). Our God cannot have said the things 
that he does not think (Zechariah 12–14 - Isaiah 6:8-10 - 66:1-2 - Acts 7:37-53). Let us live by your 
side by continually seeking our true brothers (Zechariah 12–14), it is the will of God. It is written 
very clearly in this book which we received and which was translated a long time ago. It is not a 
religion, it is a culture and blessed race that we need to find. If you really love God, knowing that 
62 
Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew (Luke 4:25-29), then you must help us to find them. [It is logical to 
think that the book of Ezekiel was not yet recognized by the Jewish leaders when they returned 
from exile and rebuilt the temple of Yahweh. And if they were aware of it, then they must have 
thought that the new laws concerning the construction and working of the temple may concern a 
distant future, at the coming of the mysterious prince who is described in Ezekiel and who will have 
unusual rights among the children of Israel (1 Rommel 3:49), for the exact identity of God is still 
unknown in those days. For this revelation to the prophet Ezekiel occurred during the twenty fifth 
year of the captivity of king Jehoiachin (Ezekiel 1:2 - 40:1), that is to say fourteen years after the 
destruction of the temple of Yahweh which had been built in Jerusalem by king Solomon, since this 
temple was destroyed at the end of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah who reigned eleven years 
after the departure into captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and it was after seventy years of 
captivity that there was a voluntary return of the captives (Jeremiah 25:9-12 - 2 Chronicles 36:21
23). And Ezekiel even proposes to return backwards (Jeremiah 7:21-24), until the time when there 
was no king in Israel, and to restore the supreme function of judge only to the Levites (Ezekiel 
44:23-24 - 2 Kings 15:5 - 2 Samuel 15:1-6 - 1 Samuel 8:1-9 - Deuteronomy 17:8-13).] 
25 James the Just, not John's brother who is James the Great (Acts 12:1-3), emphasized the need for 
privileged intermediaries between God and men and if this is not very clear in the book of Acts 
(Acts 15:13-21), it is more precise in the epistle where the following thing is written. 
26 Is anyone among you sick. Let him call the elders of the Church and let these elders pray for him 
and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the 
Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him. Therefore confess 
your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. For the fervent prayer 
of a righteous man is very useful (James 5:14-16). 
27 Therefore the jewish law and the temple and the twelve tribes of Israel must not be questioned. 
Furthermore, very official sources have taught us that the gospels of Matthew and Mark are 
authentic and precede Luke and John. And there we can read the following thing and note that 
additional and ambiguous commandments are added to the ten commandments, so that one can 
think that Jesus Christ was not referring only to the ten commandments when he was declaring the 
commandments that are necessary and sufficient to inherit eternal life (Luke 6:31 - John 13:34-35)]. 
28 Jesus answered him, Why have you called me good. Only one is good, namely God. If you want 
to enter life, keep the commandments. And the man asked Jesus, Which ones. And Jesus answered, 
You will not kill, and you will not commit adultery, and you will not steal, and you will not bear 
false witness, and honor your father and your mother, and: you will love your neighbor as yourself 
(Matthew 19:17-19). Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good. None is good but God alone. You 
know the commandments: You will not commit adultery, and you will not kill, and you will not 
steal, and you will not bear false witness, and you will not harm anyone, and honor your father and 
mother (Mark 10:18-19). 
29 Moreover a very important message was transmitted that if you find people troubling the social 
order and creating or maintaining community conflicts by their teachings to the public then do not 
seek to correct them or to put and end to these conflicts because God himself will take care of it 
when he wants to do it as explained in the following extract. 
63 
30 And he told them another parable by saying, The kingdom of heaven is like the case of a man 
who sowed good seeds in his field. But while the people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed 
undesirable seeds among the wheat, and departed. And when the good seeds grew and bore fruit, the 
undesirable elements also appeared. And the servants of the householder came and said to him, 
Master have you not sown good seeds in your field. From where then come these undesirable 
elements. And he said to them, An enemy has done this. Then the servants said to him, Do you want 
us to bring them out of the field. But he replied, No lest by uprooting the undesirable elements you 
uproot the wheat with them. First collect the unwanted elements and bind them into packages to 
burn them. And then gather the wheat into my granary (Matthew 13:24-30). 
31 Do you no longer respect the word of your lord. You must leave us alone and the world must 
know that we are looking for twelve blessed tribes. Let everyone serve the God of their fathers and 
as far as we are concerned, we will sneakily find or create our brothers among the most deserving 
but not only so as not to arouse too much suspicion, and establish a strong and worthy community, 
and enlighten humanity.  
32 We also have territorial demands because God has shown us the exact limits of the territory 
where he will exercise his power. 
33 We are not dogs, far from it, we are also human beings. We are not comedians, it is not the spirit 
of deception that unites us. 
34 And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried and said to him: Have 
mercy on me, O Lord, you the son of David. For my daughter is miserably tormented by a demon. 
But he did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came and begged him by saying: Send her 
away, for she is weeping behind us. And he answered: I have only been sent to the lost sheep of the 
house of Israel. But she came and worshiped him by saying: Help me Lord. And he answered and 
said: It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs. And she said: Yes 
Lord, but even the little dogs eat crumbs that fall from their masters' table. Then Jesus answered and 
said to her: O woman, great is your faith. Let it be done to you as you wish. And her daughter was 
healed at that same hour (Matthew 15:22-28). 
35 Let us give glory to our God, because he is the rock. The God of our heart: this is what we are, 
this is what we deserve.
