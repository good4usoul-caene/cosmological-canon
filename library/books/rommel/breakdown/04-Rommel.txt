1 Introduction.  
4 Rommel 1  
2 Rigorously it is legitimate to designate a living being by any information that it has actually 
created in the world and whose evolution, over time and under the effect of various interactions, has 
produced such or such other describable consequence.  
3 With this approach an identity does not disappear when the living being becomes inert and a 
notion of eternal life is scientifically possible. 
4 One is present in eternal life when one has contributed physically or morally to the genealogy of 
something that exists, a material object or knowledge. And this contribution is exactly the form of 
our heavenly body. 
5 However, at best one imagines a density of presence of such person in such accessible reality but 
this definition of eternal life does not allow the scientist to carry out a hierarchy of responsibilities 
so as to be able to clarify the religious notions of hell and heaven. 
6 In other words, to be saved directly or to be saved only through fire (eventually by undergoing a 
progressive eradication of one’s presence in eternal life to leave at most a disgusting memory - 
Deuteronomy 29:20 - John 6:47-50,51-58 - Numbers 14:21-23,27-32 - Luke 20:34-38).  
1593 
7 A different analysis helps to understand this classification. 
8 The world around us seems to be changing in two ways in any place at any time. There are 
modifications whose origin is simply a natural phenomenon which does not involve any direct 
contribution of a living being.  
9 And there are modifications undertaken by a living being in order to satisfy at least one of the 
three fundamental desires namely: (a) Solve what seems to be a problem for one's well-being. (b) 
Obtain from certain others physical or moral compensation. (c) Contribute to the development of 
those who may resemble oneself in their search for a purpose in their lives.  
10 A state of mind is a superimposition of one or more fundamental desires. 
11 And whatever its state of mind at an arbitrarily chosen moment in its existence, a living being 
modifies the world by carrying out either an innovation or an imitation of a knowledge transmitted 
to it by specific sources.  
12 The perceptible universe is therefore transformed by a combination of natural causes, and 
imitations and innovations based on a set of knowledge acquired and carried out under different 
states of mind by living beings.  
13 Here is the message of faith in Jesus Christ. 
14 Each heavenly body is described by an abstract concept that characterizes its impact on those 
who are physically alive. Every physical being is an embodiment of an abstract concept in the sense 
that its actions, which depend on the information at its disposal, are always consistent with its 
intrinsic nature (Jeremiah 1:5 - Romans 8:29). 
15 There is a state of mind called the holy spirit. It is the deep conviction of being well-intentioned 
in relation to arbitrarily chosen strangers in society. 
16 This spirit is the friend of Abraham, and the mighty of Jacob, and the shadow of David, and the 
master of the great kings Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus, and the God of Israel.  
17 All ordinary human beings are born without being indwelt by the holy spirit and without having 
knowledge of this notion therefore they must commit sins because by definition a sin is only a 
wilful or involuntary offense towards God the holy spirit (Jeremiah 22:13-16 - Psalms 14:1-7 - 
24:1-10 - 1 Chronicles 28:9 - Luke 21:14-15). 
18 The holy spirit can be offended between conception and birth, before coming out of the womb.  
19 And when one acquires knowledge of this notion, one cannot be indwelt by the holy spirit 
without obtaining in some way from those who are still physically alive, if we have the possibility, 
forgiveness of those whom we have actually offended without any publicly acceptable motivation. 
[But since the holy spirit is a state of mind, a person can acquire the holy spirit by understanding 
what needs to be done and by making a firm inner resolution to do it.] 
20 For in eternal life we are not what we are credited with but what we have actually done (2 
Rommel 6 - 4 Rommel 6:21-22). 
1594 
21 Or without having ourselves forgiven those who have offended us, but forgiveness does not 
mean forgetting and ignoring it by not taking appropriate precautions at a later stage (1 Corinthians 
5:9-13). David’s sin was forgiven but he still received a punishment (2 Samuel 12:10-14). 
22 The acquisition of the holy spirit makes a person a new creature through the concerns that now 
constitute one’s motivations (2 Corinthians 6:14-18 - Colossians 3:1-11 - Philippians 4:8-9). 
23 Not everyone is destined for eternal life (1 John 2:19-20) since one is led to eternal shame by 
blasphemy against the holy spirit, when one commits any sin after acquiring a perfect knowledge of 
this notion.  
24 Our actions always depend on the totality of the information that is at our disposal in real time 
and it is only works carried out under the influence of the holy spirit (3 Rommel 1:16-17) that are 
strengthened (2 Chronicles 20:34-37 – 25:5-10 - Psalms 101 - 133 - Proverbs 31:1-9 - Jeremiah 45 - 
Ecclesiastes 3:14 - Malachi 1:1-5), possibly in the form of an accumulated experience (Jeremiah 
36), so as to endure eternally by their admirable consequences (1 Rommel 3:30-32 - 2 Chronicles 
9:7-8 - John 17:1-3 - Ephesians 1:15-19,20-23).    
25 In eternal life innovations shine as stars and imitations shine as the splendor of sky, God having 
prepared for each elect an original achievement likely to be indefinitely imitated by those who 
know about it (2 Kings 7:1-9 - John 14:1-2). 
4 Rommel 2  
1 Motivation (John 6:29 - Proverbs 1:7), first part: Searching for the God of scientists.  
2 He created everything, the heavenly bodies and the earthly bodies, and he manifested himself to 
different people of different peoples and chose some to keep written records.  
3 He freed them from slavery under the guidance of Moses who gives the people laws to practice 
and prophecies. Obedience assures them a peaceful life and disobedience subjects them to servitude 
to other communities (Deuteronomy 4:25-31,32-40). 
4 So much so that the good conscience of one of them towards a great king allows them to obtain 
permission to defend themselves in the book of Esther.  
5 And later comes someone who claims to be the door of the sheep and the light of the world. And 
his disciples say of the newcomer that he is the heir of everything, and that in fact he was there from 
the beginning. 
6 Does a scientist have the right to seek the purpose of life through one's his specialty or through 
any source of information.  
7 Jean Thill: I think that these questions are not helpful to save your Soul.  
8 Answer: The words of truth are always paradoxical, Lao Tzu.  
9 Science does not establish all of the phenomena that occur in nature, but allows us to reject what 
is not consistent with a specific set of hypotheses. One cannot affirm that science is contrary to faith 
1595 
without having first clarified what this faith consists of, and my faith is not based on Adam and Eve 
and Paradise but rather on this proposition P, Truth is the light of men.  
10 This observation appeared to me while reading the gospels and the apostles, I would not have 
done it alone. And I interpret it in these other words: God is the notion of truth. 
11 My proof of proposition P comes from an obvious paradox. Indeed, if there exists a theory, a 
system of hypotheses, that makes it possible to prove that P is false, then this demonstration of the 
falsity of P can be considered as the only lie that claims to enlighten men.  
12 A pagan imagines that a few little lies can serve just causes. The one who blasphemes is the one 
who falsifies the results or the interpretation of the process of constructing a physics experiment for 
the sole purpose of promoting a certain theory. Blaspheming is lying in the name of truth and I think 
that truth is a relative notion.  
13 Alexander Yurkin: When to me there were so many years as to you, I thought too that the truth is 
a relative concept, but there was it no so. There is such Ancient Greek logical paradox: ‘All Cretans 
lie, Cretan Brut has told’. The truth was told by Cretan Brut or he has told a lie? For 2,5 thousand 
years nobody could give the answer to this question. (Reference: Crete is the main Greek island on 
which there lived antique Greeks, and now there live modern Greeks.)   
14 Answer: I esteem Jesus of Nazareth. It is because of him and his apostles that I know that I must 
worship and serve the truth itself, the truth that is within me, and not the people who claim to 
possess it or the objects that are said to shelter it.  
15 a. If the Cretan citizen has not lied in relation to his relative truth, then he really thinks deeply 
that all Cretans lie. b. If the Cretan Brut has lied about his relative truth, then he deeply thinks inside 
himself that there may be Cretans who do not lie. Alexander I think that (a) leads to a contradiction 
while (b) is mathematically acceptable since the Cretan Brut is not God. My solution is therefore 
that Cretan Brut is a liar. 
16 It could be argued that a paradox is logical in nature when it can be analyzed using the definition 
that truth is the conformity between what a person transmits and what that person actually knows. 
And that a paradox that is not of a logical nature is of a semantic nature. 
17 This approach to truth is not a semantic theory of truth but rather a correspondence of truth with 
an idealist position. According to my approach, if I consider that a person is crazy then I must admit 
that this person can be wrong but cannot be a liar because, because of his madness, everything he 
transmits is consistent with his knowledge.  
18 This is a common practice in society when individuals declare that others are or are not 
responsible for the facts they produce. Indeed, even if a person tells the truth, he can only provide 
satisfactory answers, including silence, if he is asked the right questions. Thus, since a madman is 
never considered a liar in all human societies and is not held responsible for his actions, truth is a 
relative notion.  
19 Job spoke according to his heart (Job 6:1-10,25-30 - 7:11-16 - 9:15) and Elihu spoke according 
to his heart (Job 32:1-10 - 33:1-3). And despite their opposition, both were approved by the angel of 
God (Job 34:31-37 - 42:7). For the three friends of Job have simply made poetry without being truly 
1596 
imbued with the holy spirit, since they condemn him for a sin that they cannot identify (1 Rommel 
1:33) while Elihu condemns him for an arrogant reaction. Nevertheless Elihu acted with the 
intention of comforting Job and in his way of doing so, he chose not to put himself completely in 
Job's place because the spirit of the Lord does not flourish in despair (Job 32:1-5 - 33:31-33 - 37:19 - 2 Chronicles 5:11-14 - 7:1-3) but rather in the search for improvement (Ecclesiastes 7:1-4). Job 
did not lose hope of meeting his God after his death (Job 19:25-29), but he preferred that this death 
take place as soon as possible because he did not want to endure the suffering any longer. And Job 
says that he has been righteous for as long as he can remember (Job 10:1-2 - 27:1-7), but he also 
recognizes that an ordinary person cannot have been completely righteous from birth (Job 13:26 - 
14:4).  
20 And in addition, the Bible claims to describe the God of scientists (Proverbs 1:7 - John 1:3-4).  
21 If we are to trust only Christ (2 Peter 3:1-2 - Jeremiah 9:4-5) because we cannot identify with 
certainty those who truly love God (1 Kings 13:7-32 - Jeremiah 17:5-10).  
22 And that Christ's servants are to be seen only as examples to be followed (Philippians 3:15-21 - 1 
Peter 5:1-5) and never as gods (Philippians 3:1-3 - 2 Peter 2:1-2 - 1 Thessalonians 5:21).  
23 Then why should anyone else be trusted.  
24 And here those who receive tithes are mortal men. But there it is one of whom it is witnessed 
that he is alive. And to put it bluntly, Levi who receives the tithe paid the tithe through Abraham. 
For he was still in the waist of his father when Melchizedek went to meet Abraham (Hebrews 7:8
10). Additionally, there were many priests because death prevented them from being permanent. But 
this man, because he remains eternally, has a priesthood that is not transferable (Hebrews 7:23-24).  
25 Obey those who have power over you [in matters of faith] and submit yourselves. For they watch 
over your souls as having to give account. Let it be so, so that they may do it with joy and not with 
grief because this is not profitable for you (Hebrews 13:17).  
26 Hell must not simply mean falling into oblivion, but also a permanent memory of what is not to 
be done and that has not been forgiven in some way (Jeremiah 20:10-11 - 23:33-40 - Ezekiel 13:1-9 - Zechariah 1:1-5,6 - John 8:21-24). Jeroboam is the first king of the kingdom of Israel which was 
created after the separation of the people of Israel into two kingdoms [Saul and David and Solomon 
are the only ones to have reigned over all of Jacob]. And the punishment of Jeroboam was carried 
out by Baasha the third king of the kingdom of Israel (1 Kings 14:1-9,10-16 - 15:25-30), and 
nevertheless the sin of Jeroboam remained throughout the existence of the kingdom of Israel (2 
Kings 13:1-13 - 14:23-27 - 17:21-23 - Amos 4:1-5,6-13) and continues to exist in our memories. 
And during the whole time of the patience of God (2 Peter 3:15 - Ecclesiastes 8:11-13 - 4 Rommel 
6:19-20), there have been people pleasing to God in the kingdom of Israel like king Jehu who 
created his own legacy in the form of the knowledge that we have of his behavior, despite the fact 
that he did not renounce the bad social organization that had been instituted by Jeroboam (1 Kings 
12:26-31 - 2 Chronicles 11:1-12,13-17 - 13:1-12 - 2 Kings 10:28-31). But Jehu had also destroyed 
Ahaziah king of Judah and his family without being asked (Hosea 1:1-5 - 1 Rommel 3:20). And in 
those days of the patience of God regarding the memory of Jeroboam in the kingdom of Israel, 
Yahweh used Joash king of Israel to punish Amaziah, king of Judah concerning a personal 
transgression (2 Chronicles 25). And there were also good prophets [namely true prophets] in the 
1597 
kingdom of Israel like Elijah the Tishbite and Elisha, and others who have been mentioned, and all 
those who transmitted this knowledge to us, but Yahweh was not patient any longer because of the 
behavior of the people (Amos 5–8). Moreover, Manasseh has caused the destruction of the kingdom 
of Judah (2 Kings 21:1-16 - 24:1-4 - 2 Chronicles 33:1-9 - Jeremiah 15:1-4,5-7 - 19:1-5,6-15 - 
32:29-35) but we also have the memory of his repentance (2 Chronicles 33:10-17). And it was the 
behavior of the people in the kingdom of Judah that did not encourage Yahweh to be patient any 
longer (Jeremiah 4:1-4,5-10 - 22:1-4,5-9 - 26:1-6,7-15 - 36:1-4,16-26 - 38:14-23 - 34:1-7,8-22 - 
52:1-11 - Ezekiel 8:1-6,7-18 - 17:12-21 - 2 Chronicles 36:1-13,14-16 - 2 Kings 25:1-7 - The book 
of Jeremiah is not written in chronological order, but in thematic groupings - Jeremiah 36:32), as he 
was patient during the days of Josiah (2 Kings 22:11-20 - 23:25-27). Now it can be deduced from 
the scriptures that some of the people obey the word of Jeremiah every time that he repeats the same 
warnings, while there is a part of the people who choose the hardness of heart (Jeremiah 21:8-12 - 
37:11-16 - 38:1-5,17-20).  
27 Similarly, in Galatians 5:3 'μαρτύρομαι δὲ πάλιν' cannot mean 'I attest' or 'I declare' but rather 'I 
protest' as indicated by some commentators who choose to assume that the word protest is used here 
to reinforce an argument and not to contest it. Yet it is evident that in the same document and the 
other letters associated with the apostles Paul and Peter and John, the teaching is that salvation 
comes only from faith in Christ (Galatians 5:6-12 - Acts 10:34-43 - 15:5-11) and not from the 
practice of the law namely the Moses' pedagogical law.  
28 But Christ does not forbid honoring the Levites while the physical temple which is their 
workplace is not yet destroyed (Deuteronomy 10:5-9 - 18:1-8 - Isaiah 42:3 - Luke 5:12-14 - 11:42 - 
Acts 6:1-7,8-15 - Luke 21:5-8 - 14:34-35 - 4 Rommel 12:50-52).  
29 Furthermore, the content of the Hebrew Bible is said to be identical to that of the Old Testament 
of the Protestant Bible and is different from that of the Old Testament of the Roman Catholic 
Church and that of the Old Testament of the Eastern Orthodox Church.  
30 And it is said that since the first centuries there have been discussions, in which honest and 
dishonest people might have participated, about the admissibility of the various books that 
constitute the current canon of the New Testament for their conformity to the teachings of Jesus of 
Nazareth. Either because of the content or because of the supposed authors.  
31 For example, some documents about the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth contain structural 
contradictions that concern more than just circumstantial details (2 Kings 24:8 - 2 Chronicles 36:9 - 
Genesis 46:27 - Exodus 1:5 - Acts 7:13-15 - Acts 9:1-9 - 22:1-11) having no consequence on the 
useful teachings that the reader is supposed to extract from the texts (2 Kings 2:23-25 - 1 
Corinthians 10:6). And there are only a few instances in the Bible in which the books were written 
and successively copied through the centuries by ordinary men, and some of them were simply 
possessed by the holy spirit.  
32 This is the case of the Gospel of Thomas where we can notice the opposition between these two 
verses: (12) The disciples said to Jesus, We are aware that you will depart from us. Who will be our 
leader. And Jesus answered, No matter where you come from, it is to James the Just that you should 
go, for whose sake heaven and earth have come to exist. (77) Jesus said, It is I who am the light that 
presides over all. It is I who am the entirety. It is from me that the entirety has come, and to me that 
1598 
the entirety goes. Split a piece of wood, and I am inside. Lift a stone, and you will find me 
underneath.  
33 And we can also notice that unlike the Gospel of John (John 1:17-18), the message of the epistle 
of James is not consistent with the Hebrew Bible (Deuteronomy 13:1-4 - 32:39-40 - Judges 2:2
3,21-23) and that is why I reject his work (Luke 11:17-18). For James has said the following thing. 
34 Let no man say when he is tempted, It is God who is tempting me. For God cannot be tempted 
by evil, and he himself tempts no one (James 1:13).  
35 Moreover, the main sacred text of Islam, the muslim religion, was revealed nearly six centuries 
after the story of Jesus of Nazareth according to what is said. And Jesus is mentioned there as a 
prophet sent to the Jewish people, and it is affirmed there that God cannot have sons and that it is a 
sin to worship as God a man or his mother who conceived him in virginity.  
36 O People of the Book. Do not go to extremes regarding your faith, and say nothing about Allah 
except the truth. The messiah Jesus, the son of Miriam, was no more than a messenger of Allah and 
the fulfilment of his word through Miriam, and a spirit created by a command from him. So believe 
in Allah and his messengers and do not say, Trinity. Stop, for your own good. Allah is only one God. 
Glory be to him, he is far above having a son. To him belongs whatever is in the heavens and 
whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as administrator of affairs (Quran 4:171).  
37 Those who say, Allah is the messiah, the son of Miriam. They have certainly fallen into disbelief. 
For the messiah himself said, O children of Israel, worship Allah my Lord and your Lord. 
Therefore, anyone who associates others with Allah in worship will surely be forbidden Paradise by 
Allah. Their home will be the fire, and the wrongdoers will have no helpers. Those who say, Allah 
is one in the Trinity, they have certainly fallen into disbelief because there is only one God. If they 
continue to say this, those among them who disbelieve will be afflicted with a painful punishment. 
Will they not turn to Allah to repent and ask for his forgiveness? And Allah is forgiving and 
merciful. The Messiah the son of Miriam was only a messenger. Many messengers had come and 
gone before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth, and they both used to eat food. Look how 
clearly we explain the signs to them, and then look how they are deluded (Quran 5:72-75).  
38 And on Judgment Day Allah will say, O Jesus the son of Miriam. Did you ever ask the people to 
worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah. And he will answer, Glory be to You. How 
could I ever say what I had no right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly 
known it. You know what is hidden within me, but I do not know what is within you. Indeed, You 
alone are the knower of all unseen. I never told them anything except what you ordered me to say, 
Worship Allah my Lord and your Lord. And I was witness over them as long as I remained among 
them. But when you took me, you were the witness over them and you are a witness over all things. 
If you punish them, they belong to You after all. But if you forgive them, you are surely the 
Almighty, All-Wise (Quran 5:116-118).  
39 They say, The Most Compassionate has offspring. You have certainly made an outrageous claim, 
by which the heavens are about to burst, and the earth to split apart, and the mountains to crumble 
to pieces, in protest of attributing children to the Most Compassionate. It does not befit the majesty 
of the Most Compassionate to have children. There is none in the heavens or the earth who will not 
return to the Most Compassionate in full submission. Allah has never had any offspring, nor is there 
1599 
any god besides him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what he created, and they would 
have tried to dominate one another. Glorified is Allah above what they claim. He is the knower of 
the seen and unseen. Exalted is he above what they associate with him (Quran 19:88-93 - 23:91).  
40 My design is distinguished by the precise answers given to the following questions concerning 
the role that christianity can attribute to Jesus of Nazareth within judaism.  
41 If there is a creator and a divine will that we must know then what is the definition of a sin and 
how does someone obtain the forgiveness of his sins (Zechariah 8:16-17 - John 8:23-25).  
42 If Jesus of Nazareth is the king who announces the good news to all nations, and if the temple of 
God is his body, then who are the authorized intermediaries between him and his people. And how 
does he convey his instructions to his people (Zechariah 6:12-13 - John 2:18-22).  
43 Dora Simunovic: Let me tell you a (legendary, semi-mythical) story of the Spartan king 
Leonidas and the Persian emperor Xerxes. Persia was keen to invade Greece, including Sparta, and 
take over their control of the Eastern Mediterranean. Persia was a vastly larger empire, much richer 
and more powerful. But Spartans were famous warriors who lived in karst mountain mazes. It was 
going to be a difficult fight to invade Sparta, especially if the other Greek tribes joined in to help 
them. As it happened, the other Greek tribes did not join due to Persian political meddling.  
44 So Xerxes wrote one last letter to Leonidas, saying, “If we conquer your land by force, we will 
kill your sons, rape your women, main your soldiers, slaughter your cattle, burn your fields and sow 
them with salt. Give up your arms, and you will be spared this fate!” Leonidas replied, “If”. (This is 
how it is often remembered. In reality, Leonidas was even cooler than that. When Xerxes told him 
to give up his arms, Leonidas wrote back, “Come and take them”.). 
45 I say the same to you. “If”. If the temple of god is the body of Jesus, etc. Well, why would we 
accept this? This is just another claim you are adding to a set of your other claims. Where is the 
evidence? Why do you believe this? What convinced you in the first place?  
46 But it goes beyond that, Rommel! How much do you know of the history of the Bible? I do not 
mean “Biblical history”, but the history of the actual book! Because, if you wish to claim that Mark 
and Matthew are fake, while Luke and John are better sources for the life of a historical Jesus, you 
are in disagreement with the vast majority of scholars whose job it is to know these things.  
47 With a minimum of research, you will find that Mark is, to the best of our knowledge, the oldest 
of the canonical gospels. It is also probably the oldest document about Jesus, with the possible 
exception of the Gospel of Phillip - which is not even in the Bible, just like the First and Second 
Apocalypse of Peter, Gospel of Mary Magdalene, Gospel of Judas, and countless others are not in 
the Bible.  
48 In the end, what is in that book, what is out of it, is almost totally arbitrary. I am glad that you 
agree there are clear moral absurdities in the Bible. However, I still don’t understand how they can 
be isolated to Judaism, Catholicism and/or Islam? Aren’t you just attacking your ideological / 
denominational opposition, while ignoring the contradictions in your own denomination?  
1600 
49 Besides, it is useless to try and convince me that Catholicism, Judaism and Islam are senseless. I 
already agree - but I include Protestantism, Hinduism, Mormonism, Shinto, and the others into this 
group as well.  
50 Answer: I am not an eyewitness to the events that would have occurred during the exodus under 
Moses, nor to the words and actions of Jesus of Nazareth about which there are different versions, 
nor to the exchanges between King Leonidas and Emperor Xerxes (I really enjoyed your 
presentation).  
51 What is interesting is to wonder, regardless of supposed historical facts, what teaching is 
scientifically acceptable or not. If during our exchange you voluntarily give me false information 
that I cannot verify, for example about the Gospel of Philip and its anteriority or its use by the other 
authors of the Gospels, I can logically only accept them if I find it useful for me because I have no 
reason to trust anyone when I have reached a certain maturity (Micah 7:5-6 - Isaiah 2:22).  
52 If I say that God exists and that righteousness is his only will in the lives of men, how have I 
offended knowledge or science. If my own denomination is described in this way, what 
contradictions do I ignore.  
53 When I realized, reading the writings of the apostles, that this is the only message they want to 
convey each in their own way (2 Peter 3:1-4), and that this is consistent with the structure of the 
Hebrew Bible, then I began to seek the face of Jesus-Christ in every excerpt of the Old Testament, 
after rejecting the writings that disfigure him in the canon of the New Testament (which included 
the Gospels according to Matthew and Mark).  
54 It is not a question of proving the historicity of the events presented but of observing that they 
are instructive for the understanding of God whose identity is defined independently of the biblical 
verses.  
55 Even in medicine, observation (the collection of data by a human subject, which can be used to 
propose theories) is an integral part of the scientific method, and this implicitly presupposes the 
righteousness and impartiality of the humans involved. Thus the Bible is simply one of the 
observations available to the investigators.  
56 If I cannot of course pronounce on the reality of the events described in these texts, I will not 
however trust the one who claims to have made research on the basis of his/her current knowledge 
and proved that Moses and the Exodus could not exist. I am satisfied to note that some communities 
have these scriptures in their traditions (Isaiah 43:9-13 - Romans 15:8-12).  
57 If I say that God exists and that righteousness and fairness are His only will in the life of men 
(Exodus 23:1-8 - Isaiah 28:17), then how have I offended knowledge. Why should I be ashamed of 
such monotheism (Galatians 3:23-26).  
58 Is it a matter of faith when it is stated that scientists have eternal life through their contributions 
to human knowledge (Luke 17:20-21 - 1 John 2:15-17). 
59 (a) I argue that if a single book was to be retained among all those who make up the New 
Testament (including the Gospels), it would be the Epistle First John although the author chose 
nuances in these expressions so that subtly addressing those who already think that the Hebrew 
1601 
Bible was inspired by God. This epistle contains everything there is to know, provided you know 
how to bring together different verses in order to grasp their true meaning. And if any notion is not 
there it is simply because it is a useless notion (1 John 5:20-21).  
60 (b) I claim that if my goal is to reach eternal life, all I have to do is behave so that I always have 
a good conscience. It means having the conviction that a court of saints, which is aware of all the 
aspects that I know about the case, all the antecedents to my knowledge and my most intimate 
motivations, will not state any condemnation against me. If I think that I need to omit or falsify any 
aspect of the elements of which I am aware, then I must know that I am committing a sin. And this 
sin will not be forgiven if I have already realized from myself previously, with conviction, that it is 
those who do not commit such sins who obtain eternal life (1 John 3:3-7,20-21 - John 7:1-10,11-14 - Luke 11:37-41).  
61 (c) I claim that a person is a christian if that person behaves always and ever so as to want to 
reach eternal life, and that a person who has not yet been a christian can become a christian. This 
implies that I cannot judge a person about a case if I do not know everything that this person know 
about this case. And it also implies that a person who calls himself a christian is not necessarily a 
christian (1 John 2:3-6 - 4:1-3).  
62 More clearly, God is the abstract concept of truth, and his only begotten Son is the abstract 
concept of love of the general interest, and the holy spirit is the inner conviction of being well
intentioned not with respect to a particular person or community but with respect to the rest of the 
world.  
63 Ordinary men are incarnations of abstract concepts and are born in darkness, their light being the 
eternal life that is found in the only begotten Son of God whose first incarnation was Jesus of 
Nazareth, a character filled with the holy spirit from birth. [During the rebuilding of the house of 
Yahweh by the people who returned from the Babylonian captivity and from elsewhere, it happened 
that the high priest Joshua (Ezra 3:8-9 - 5:1-2 - Haggai 1:1-2 - Zechariah 6:9-12) has appeared in a 
vision of the prophet Zechariah (Zechariah 1:7-10 - 3:1-2), and one of the angels of Yahweh who 
has appeared in that vision has informed us that Joshua is not the only man who had appeared there 
(Zechariah 3:3-4,5-8). And it can happen that reality is indistinguishable from the dream (Acts 12:5
11 - 2 Corinthians 12:1-4), and some people may have the gift of seeing those who are already dead 
according to the flesh (1 Samuel 28:7-14).]   
64 Our actions are consistent with our intrinsic nature and necessarily depend on the information 
available. We survive by the impact we have had in the lives of others, as the abstract concept of 
which we have been the embodiment. [This is how the behavior of a person can be known before 
his existence in the physical world (4 Rommel 1:14 - Genesis 25:20-23 - Romans 9:11-13 - Malachi 
1:1-3), and this is how Jesus can return to a place where he was before his existence in the physical 
world (Luke 1:35 - John 6:62).] 
65 Everything that occurs in nature is a realization of God, and any action of men that is not done 
by the only begotten Son of God is by definition a work of the Devil.  
66 Finally, the separation between faith and science is neither in the definition of the Father and the 
Son and the holy spirit, nor in the definition of the notion of eternal life.  
1602 
67 But on the one hand in the assertion that these are the works of God the holy spirit that are 
established for eternity so as to preserve indefinitely through their consequences a useful and 
admirable trace in the perceptible universe (Proverbs 12:19 - 2 Chronicles 9:7-8 - Habakkuk 2:9-14 - Ephesians 2:8-10).  
68 And on the other hand in the consideration of the fact that, since the notion of sin is individual, 
our sins can influence the quality of the persecutions that will be imposed on them (Exodus 34:5-7 - 
Numbers 14:26-32,33-35), but the works of our offspring, whose existence involves not one person 
but at least a couple, are not directly attributed to us (1 Corinthians 3:15 - 7:7-9 - 1 Rommel 3:14
16,30-32). 
4 Rommel 3  
1 Motivation (John 6:29 - Proverbs 1:7), second part: Personal thoughts inspired by christian 
scriptures. 
2 Do whatever you want, but never rush to do anything, no matter how urgent the situation. Always 
take a minimum of time to analyze the situation and gather information in order to be convinced to 
keep a good conscience in relation to everyone at the same time, even unknown people. And do not 
forget that you could become what you do. 
3 Christian faith is not generosity towards anyone but rather firmness in good conscience towards 
everyone at the same time, absolutely everyone and not just a few people otherwise it would be 
idolatry.  
4 The Christian Cross, the sweet sacrifice: to consider at every moment an assembly of a few people 
likely to be honest and randomly chosen from all over the population, and to wonder if knowing all 
I know and nothing but what I know, they would approve or condemn what I am doing.  
5 I learned to recognize the hand of God in each of my interactions with anyone or anything, and I 
know that if he is not experiencing my faith in Jesus Christ then it is a mission he entrusts to me.  
6 All ordinary men are born in darkness and must commit sins. But while the children of God who 
were elected before the foundation of the world felt shame or acted out of ignorance before the days 
of their conversions, the demons rather experienced pleasure when they carried out reprehensible 
works.  
7 Never rejoice at the misfortune of your enemies but be saddened by the fact that God did not grant 
them repentance so that you could support them as a friend would have done.  
8 The commonality between a demon and a child and a spiritually immature person is that each of 
them knows in his heart that some of his actions or words can only be properly justified by someone 
else. Indeed, even one who uses a technology that he did not conceive must at least be convinced to 
triumph on the day of judgment by his objective.  
9 When can we think that Christ is the motive. The motive is Christ when we seek the interest of all 
in general and no one in particular. The motive is Christ when one can justify one's actions with 
confidence by taking into account all the antecedents of which one is aware. The motive is Christ 
1603 
when we want to explain that the inheritance of God (membership to the Israel of God) is not 
distributed according to genealogies but according to faith in the holy commandment.  
10 Every masterpiece is noticed spontaneously. What is appreciated in more time is of a lower 
quality.  
11 If absolutely no one can accuse me publicly by evoking the entire history of our relationship as 
evidence, without omitting anything, then I do not commit any sin.  
12 If you think that you will be accused if what you want to do was shown to randomly selected 
strangers from all of humanity, explaining to them all the details of the context to your knowledge, 
then resist and do not do it because the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and even sins 
committed in the times of ignorance, in the distant past, must have consequences.   
13 When they make any archaeological discovery that they manage to situate in time with a certain 
precision, what motivates them to share and make public their results if it is not the exact identity of 
Christ and the purpose of life. Let them answer the question so that everything is clear once and for 
all for everyone. 
4 Rommel 4  
1 The Father and the Son and the holy spirit (John 1:17 - 10:30), first part: The Trinity. 
2 Our intrinsic nature and the totality of information at our disposal determine our actions. Jonah 
did not know the exact definition of eternal life but just a vague idea of what it is (Job 14:10-15 - 1 
Rommel 1:33), and he would prefer that God send someone else to make a fool of himself by 
announcing a real disaster that will never happen (Jonah 1:1-3 - 4:1-11). It is possible that the 
angels have already used him in this way a number of times, and it is for this reason that Jonah had 
fled, but we can think that Jonah is not perfect (Jonah 4:5-11 - 1 Rommel 3:20).  
3 And Jesus of Nazareth announces the following good news: We do not die, we simply change 
form (Zechariah 1:1-5,6 - Philippians 1:23-24 - Luke 20:34-38 - John 6:47-51 - 8:48-52 - 11:23-26 - 
12:23-26,27-34 - 1 Corinthians 15:35-50 - 2 Timothy 1:9-10 - 1 Peter 3:18). 
4 We become exactly the information that we have created in the world (John 6:51-60,61-63 - Acts 
25:19 - 1 John 3:6 - 4 Rommel 1:20 - 1 Corinthians 6:13-14 - 2 Corinthians 4:10-12) and whose 
evolution depends solely on natural phenomena and those who are physically alive, in other words 
on God the Father. [Even in experimental physical sciences (4 Rommel 1:8-12 - Colossians 2:1-3,4
9), any object that exists in the physical world does one of the following things or both at the same 
time: (a) It transforms itself into another object by undergoing modifications of any kind. (b) It 
contributes in one way or another to the changes of states of the other objects of the physical 
world.]  
5 God the Father is the abstract concept of truth. Everything that happens in nature is his work 
(Proverbs 16:1,9,33 - 19:21 - 20:24 - Amos 3:6 - Jeremiah 10:23 - Job 23:13-17 - Philippians 2:13).  
6 And it is his angels, heavenly bodies, who speak to men in visions or dreams (Genesis 22:11-16 - 
31:11-13 - Exodus 3:2-6 - 24:9-12 - 33:18-20 - Hosea 12:3-5 - Daniel 9:21-22 - 10:12-13,20-21 - 
1604 
Luke 1:18-20,26-31 - John 1:18 - Acts 12:5-11). For there are visions (Ezekiel 1:1-28 - 3:22-24), 
and there are dreams (Jeremiah 31:23-26), and sometimes the prophet can just hear a voice in his 
head (1 Samuel 9:14-19 - Acts 10:17-22).  
7 When we are unjust, it always allows God to accomplish purposes but our guilt remains because 
of the purpose of life (Romans 3:5-8 - 1 Kings 14:1-16 - 16:1-7,8-20 - Ezekiel 3:16-21 - 33:1-9,20 - 
Acts 20:24-27 - Luke 22:21-22 - Jeremiah 9:23-24). 
8 The prophets of God were those who had conversations with the angels of the holy spirit (2 Kings 
9:7 - Ezekiel 14:1-11 - 20:7 - 33:30-33 - Acts 20:17-23 - 27:21-26 - 3 Rommel 1:20-21). It is the 
consistency of the good quality of the concerns of a person that makes him a potential prophet in the 
eyes of the angels of the holy spirit (Ecclesiastes 5:1-3,4-7 - Philippians 4:8 - Jeremiah 31:23-26 - 
Daniel 9:21-23 - 1 Corinthians 11:20-28), and it is only a question of why he thinks what he thinks 
and not what he thinks about.  
9 God the holy spirit is the intimate conviction of being well-intentioned, not in relation to a 
particular person or community but in relation to arbitrarily chosen strangers in society.  
10 God the Father only strengthens the works of God the holy spirit eventually over long periods of 
time (Psalms 119:152,160 - Ecclesiastes 3:14 - Jeremiah 9:1-9 - 22:1-5,13-18 - Philippians 2:8-11 - 
Jeremiah 18:1-10,11-13) and it is in this sense that these two Gods are one and indifferently called 
by the same name in the holy scriptures.   
11 Obeying the statutes and the commandments and the ordinances of God (Genesis 26:5 - Ezekiel 
5:5-8,9-11) means obeying God the holy spirit by conforming to the customs going on in the 
surrounding society (Genesis 14:17-20 - Ezra 5 - Romans 13:1-7 - 1 Peter 2:13-17 - Luke 20:20-26) 
without ever submitting to any form of idolatry (1 Samuel 14:24-30,37-45).  
12 Consequently, invoking the name of God (Genesis 4:26 - 12:6-9 - 21:33-34 - Exodus 6:1-3) 
means claiming or celebrating justice and fairness (2 Samuel 6:12-15 - 1 Kings 8:9 - Proverbs 21:3 - 30:2-9). 
13 God the Son, also called Christ, is the abstract concept of love of general interest and Jesus of 
Nazareth was its first incarnation (Luke 1:35 - John 15:9-12).  
14 God the Son is the only intermediary between God the holy spirit and the world (Acts 25:19 - 
John 14:15-19 - 10:7-16) and it is in this sense that these two Gods are one and indifferently called 
by the same name in the holy scriptures. 
15 In a same sentence of a biblical text, each occurrence of a reference to God actually designates 
only one of these three Gods and not necessarily the same for the different occurrences (3 Rommel 
1:10).  
16 For example, since by definition everyone is in God the Father, the expression 'I am in the father' 
(John 14:10) can only have a particular meaning if this is translated by 'I remain in the love of the 
father' and since it is only the works of God the holy spirit that are loved by God the Father, the 
word father actually designates God the holy spirit who moreover is actually the real father of Jesus 
of Nazareth according to the flesh (Luke 1:34-35). 
1605 
17 God the Father (Deuteronomy 32:39 - Psalms 139:1-16 - Isaiah 66:1-2), and God the Son 
(Genesis 49:10 - 1 Chronicles 17:11-14 - Zechariah 2:10-11 - 12:10), and God the holy spirit 
(Numbers 11:24-29 - 2 Samuel 23:1-4 - 1 Kings 19:1-13). 
4 Rommel 5  
1 The Father and the Son and the holy spirit (John 1:17 - 10:30), second part: Intrinsic nature of 
embodied heavenly bodies. 
2 Human beings are incarnations of abstract concepts therefore each one always acts according to 
one’s nature but the complexity and subtleties of the different contexts can can highlight contrasts 
(2 Kings 21:1-16 - 2 Chronicles 33:10-17). 
3 By definition, to be born by being indwelled by the holy spirit so as to be physically sinless 
(Romans 6:22-23 - 1 Timothy 3:16 - Luke 24:1-5), one must be an incarnation of Christ or a 
reincarnation of a spirit who has already had knowledge of the purpose of life after necessarily 
offending the holy spirit.  
4 So if Jesus of Nazareth who teaches the exact knowledge of God paid a compliment following 
what is clearly an offense to the holy spirit (John 1:45-47 - Genesis 18:9-15) as Jonathan David 
Doolin pointed out to me, Jesus having the ability to see beyond physical appearance as he sees 
things happening at a distance (John 1:48-50), it is to teach that an ordinary person cannot be 
without sin and that one is a child of Israel by training one’s mind in holiness (1 Kings 15:5 - 1 
Rommel 3:20).  
5 Balaam who was not a member of the tribes of Israel had the gift of cursing and blessing 
(Numbers 22:5-6,10-12 - 23:8-10) but not being Jesus Christ he committed sins.  
6 Ahithophel had the gift of discerning the way God the Father acted (2 Samuel 15:31 - 16:23 - 
17:14) but not being Jesus Christ he committed sins.  
7 This other remark which is not mine but Daniel Keeran's is that the virgin Mary who had the gift 
of giving birth to the Incarnation of Christ by the power of the holy spirit (Luke 1:30-35 - 2:8-19) 
did not live without sin (Luke 2:41-50) and therefore it can be said that she was not a reincarnation 
of a spirit that had already known the truth.  
8 Finally, Jesus of Nazareth by definition lived without sin and he had the gift of forgiving others 
for the sins they committed by offending their fellowmen (Luke 5:17-26) because he was the 
incarnation of Christ which is the concept by which these sins are erased, that is, to obtain the 
forgiveness of those who have been offended without possible public justification.  
9 However, the manifestation of this particular gift is not always visible (Luke 7:36-48,49-50) and 
for a specialist of the Hebrew Bible, Jesus did nothing extraordinary except to persuade himself that 
he died while maintaining a good conscience in all circumstance even in relation to those who are 
not of his nation (Luke 4:25-27). 
10 Indeed, Jesus was born of a virgin woman (Luke 1:34-35) and therefore his father is not a man 
but it was not a first in history (Genesis 6:1-4).  
1606 
11 Jesus changed the water to wine (John 2:1-11) but Moses changed the sea to blood (Exodus 
7:17-20).  
12 Jesus multiplied the breads and the fishes (John 6:9-13) but Elijah multiplied the flour and the oil 
(1 Kings 17:14-16). 
13 Jesus threatened the storm and walked on the water (Luke 8:22-25 - John 6:16-21) but Moses 
opened the sea (Exodus 14:21).   
14 Jesus rose from the dead according to the flesh (John 11:38-44) and he himself rose (John 20:11
17) but Elijah did the same (1 Kings 17:20-24).  
15 Jesus spoke with living spirits (Luke 9:28-36) but Saul also had an exchange with the spirit of 
Samuel (1 Samuel 28:11-15). 
16 Jesus was taken up into heaven (Luke 24:50-51) but also Elijah (2 Kings 2:11). 
17 And Elisha also did similar things (2 Kings 2:7-10). 
4 Rommel 6  
1 The pedagogy initiated through Moses (Isaiah 1:2-3 - 2 Corinthians 3:12-18), first part. 
2 The necessarily imperfect laws enunciated through Moses were deliberately evil (Ezekiel 20:25) 
for some of those that occurred after revolts offending the holy spirit (Exodus 20:18-23 - 
Deuteronomy 5:22-29,30-33). [# Among the statutes that were not good in those days when the 
exact identity of God was still unknown, there was the fact that there was to be no mixing of the 
inheritances of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel (1 Rommel 3:26-27 - Numbers 36:6-9), 
membership in a tribe being determined by the fact that the paternal genealogy goes back to one of 
the twelve sons of Jacob whose name was changed in Israel. This separation could have existed 
geographically from the beginning (Numbers 26:52-56) but it has not be done thus (3 Rommel 
1:35). # There was also the obligation to perform in the future all rituals at a single place that will 
be chosen from one of the tribes of Israel (Deuteronomy 12:5-8,9-26 - 4 Rommel 12:18 - 1 Rommel 
3:40 - 1 Chronicles 17:1-2 - 21:15-27,28-30 - 22:1-2 - John 4:45 - 11:55), despite the fact that the 
tribe of the Levites which contains the family of the priests has cities scattered throughout all the 
tribes of Israel (Numbers 35:1-8). But this obligation which was at the origin of the transgression of 
the kingdom of Israel (1 Kings 12:26-31 - 2 Chronicles 11:1-12,13-17 - 13:1-12 - 2 Kings 13:1-13 - 
14:23-27 - 17:21-23 - Amos 4:1-5,6-13) was a good thing if we consider the fact that the 
introduction of a house of God with specific operating laws is the answer given to a transgression 
(Jeremiah 7:21-24 - Leviticus 21:16-24 - 1 Rommel 3:16-17,24-25 - What is the use of the Nazirites 
when there are on the one hand the priests the sons of Aaron and all the other Levites to work in the 
sanctuary of Yahweh, and on the other hand the prophets chosen by the spirit to speak the words of 
Yahweh - Jeremiah 5:30-31 - Haggai 1:12-15 - 2:1-5 - Zechariah 7:1-3 - Deuteronomy 18:15-19,20
22 - Numbers 6:1-8,9-12,13-18,19-21 - Amos 2:11-12 -  But in those days one could take the 
nazirite vow in the hope of being chosen by the spirit of God to become a prophet - Numbers 6:22
27 - 15:37-41), and therefore it is supposed to disappear when the people will have received the 
perfect knowledge of the exact identity of Yahweh (2 Rommel 7 - John 1:29-34 - Acts 1:1-5,6-8 - 
1607 
Acts 20:24-28,29-35 - John 8:29-32). It is easy to note that the things that should be done in the 
temple of Yahweh had a pedagogical nature (4 Rommel 7:13-20,21-24 - 3 Rommel 2:28-29,30-32 - 
John 1:11-14 - 1 Rommel 1:37), and even before the disappearance of the temple there has been 
creation of assemblies in the various places of the dwellings of the people in order to teach the exact 
knowledge of Yahweh (4 Rommel 12:70 - Ephesians 4:8-13,14-24). # And among the judgments 
that were not good in those days was the fact of having to destroy and never rebuild any city in the 
territory given to the descendants of Jacob, when the inhabitants of that city willfully turned away 
from the will to serve the God of Israel (Deuteronomy 13:12-16,17-18 - Jeremiah 8:4-9 - John 9:26
29). Does this judgment included in the commandments given to the children of Israel not appear to 
be wonderful after Jesus Christ revealed the exact identity of the God of Israel (John 8:21-28 - 9:39
41). I repeat it, Yahweh is magnificent in holiness and worthy of praise (Deuteronomy 4:1-6,7-8 - 
17:1-13), for I have found no theological error in the totality of the verses that I have identified as 
being able to be inspired by the holy spirit (Jeremiah 23:28-29). And I have absolutely not altered 
the five books of the Torah of Moses except by sometimes clarifying the meaning of the words, and 
I have almost not altered the other thirteen books of the history part (1 Rommel 3:45-46), and I have 
only deleted some verses and some chapters in all the other books.] 
3 And they only allowed to learn the differences of things and prepare the life and death of Jesus of 
Nazareth who had to explain the substance of the ten commandments (Exodus 20:1-17 - 
Deuteronomy 4:9-13,14-19,20-24 - 5:1-21) in an environment where the various forms of idolatry 
were suppressed to the maximum (Exodus 31:12-18 - Numbers 15:29-36 - Ezekiel 20:12 - Luke 
6:6-11 - 13:10-17 - John 9:1-5,6-16 - 10:17-21 - 5 Rommel 5:17-22 - 7:19-22 - 2 Corinthians 5:19
21). For it must be considered that among all the commandments given to Moses, those that did not 
only specify the nuances that must be considered when putting the ten commandments into practice 
(Exodus 21:28-29 - Job 32:1-3,4-10 - 5 Rommel 5:40 - 7:9 - 3 Rommel 2:24-25) were in fact a 
response concerning the golden calf which made Yahweh angry (3 Rommel 1:46-47), because all 
the people had heard the voice of Yahweh without seeing an image near the mountain (1 Rommel 
3:21-23 - 1 Kings 8:9,18-21 - 2 Chronicles 5:10 - 6:10-11). [Now Jesus has not asked to seek to 
reproduce the actions that he has done (John 13:12-15), but rather to seek to obey the 
commandment to which he has obeyed (John 13:34-35 - 14:15 - 15:12,17 - Luke 6:31 - 10:16 - John 
13:16,20 - 4 Rommel 11:32-39 - 12:53-56). For the one who believes in Jesus (John 8:30-31 - 
12:44-45,46-47 - 14:22-24 - 15:10-11 - 1 John 2:3-6 - Luke 6:46-49) cannot seek to reproduce each 
of the actions that he has done, and this fact can be understood through the following two realities. 
On the one hand, at each feast of the Jews, or at least during certain occurrences of some of the 
feasts instituted in the law of Moses (John 2:12-13 - 7:1-3 - 13:1) and during an occurrence of the 
feast of Dedication which is a celebration not existing in the law of Moses but related to certain 
events that had occurred during the improvement of the construction of the temple (John 10:22-24), 
Jesus has come in the place of the temple of the Jewish people where was the altar of the burnt 
offerings that the law of Moses asked to offer to God alone, and where was also the only altar of 
incense (Luke 1:5-10 - 1 Rommel 3:37), and this temple was placed in Jerusalem since the time of 
Solomon king of Israel (Deuteronomy 12:5-8,9-26 - 4 Rommel 12:18 - 1 Rommel 3:40 - 1 
Chronicles 17:1-2 - 21:15-27,28-30 - 22:1-2 - John 4:45 - 11:55). And on the other hand, Jesus has 
taught that this unique temple of the rituals of the Jewish people, which is not the only place of 
1608 
teaching of the knowledge of God in those days (4 Rommel 12:70), will not continue to exist in 
future generations (John 2:14-21 - 4:19-21 - Luke 21:1-8).] 
4 The following things happened before the destruction of their temple (Deuteronomy 32:1-12 - 
Isaiah 28:8-16).  
5 If the incomparable Moses died at the age of one hundred and twenty years without entering the 
promised land (Deuteronomy 32:45-52 - 34:1-12), after leading the people for forty years in the 
wilderness (Exodus 7:1-7 - Numbers 33:1-5,36-41). 
6 It is because God is not in a physically perceptible destination but rather in the quality of the 
journey (Numbers 20:1-13 - 35:15-34).  
7 He who lives physically can hope to obtain something after the death of his body as is implied in 
the books of Job and Samuel and Daniel (Job 19:23-29 - 1 Samuel 28:6-15 - Daniel 3:14-18), and a 
beloved of God was taken away prematurely in relation to his ascendants and descendant (Genesis 
5:21-24), and Elijah also was taken away (2 Kings 2:11).  
8 And the love of God is obtained only by faith in Christ, which does not forbid honoring the 
Levites while the physical temple which is their place of service is not yet destroyed (Isaiah 42:1-8).  
9 This teaching became understandable only after the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth (Luke 
22:66-71 - 24:18-27 - Acts 3:17-26 - 1 Timothy 1:12-13) which highlighted the coexistence 
between two realities that one could imagined distinct, namely the physical body and the heavenly 
body (Luke 24:30-32 - John 20:8-9,27-29 - 1 Peter 3:18 - Acts 8:26-29,38-40 - 10:1-8 - 12:5-11). 
10 Each person always acts in accordance with one's intrinsic nature (Luke 6:41-45).  
11 And at any time in the history of the universe, our presence in eternal life (Daniel 12:2-3) is 
determined by our actual contribution in the genealogy of something that exists.  
12 Whether it is a physical contribution or a moral contribution (2 Samuel 21:15-22 - 1 Chronicles 
20:4-8), a knowledge (Ephesians 4:25-27) or material entity (Genesis 11:4 - Joshua 22:29 - 24:26
27 - 1 Samuel 2:31-36 - 6:13-18 - 2 Samuel 18:18 - Genesis 15:13-16 - Exodus 12:35-36 - 
Deuteronomy 23:13-14 - 2 Kings 5:15-17 - 10:9-11 - 2 Chronicles 8:11 - Deuteronomy 16:21-22).  
13 Thus, to assert that God wrote words on tablets of stone is to assert that Moses wrote it when he 
was completely under the influence of the spirit of God (Exodus 34:1,27-28 - Deuteronomy 10:1-5). 
But because of the insistence of the expressions used in the biblical narrative, it seems necessary to 
think that the first two tablets of the covenant that Moses broke (Exodus 32:19) were solely the 
work of an angel of God (Exodus 31:18 - 32:15-16 - Deuteronomy 9:9-11 - Daniel 5:3-4,5-7), and 
that Moses only contributed to the realization of the other two tablets of the covenant which were 
not broken again in the same way that David had written the plans of the immobile house of 
Yahweh while being under the influence of the spirit of Yahweh (1 Chronicles 28:19). [Now the 
particular words that Jesus has spoken in John 10:10-11,17-18 suggest that the angel who gave the 
ten commandments to the people, namely the one who spoke to the assembly of the children of 
Israel gathered at the foot of the mountain and perhaps also the one who wrote the ten 
commandments on the first two stone tablets that were broken by Moses, was Christ himself (5 
Rommel 5:10-12 - 4 Rommel 2:62-65 - John 14:8-9 - 1 Corinthians 10:1-4). For the commandment 
1609 
concerning the sabbath day was given solely so that an incarnation of Christ may come to make 
known that the holy spirit is the true God whose role is to give us access to an eternal life that exists 
among us (4 Rommel 4:3-4 - 14:1-4).] 
14 If we make something disappear, we will be present wherever the absence of that thing is noticed 
by all those who knew about it. 
15 The one who has not seen corruption (Acts 13:32-39) is the one about whom there is reason to 
believe that he is not physically dead.  
16 Thus the great reward of those who actually retained the multiple commandments of Moses 
before the coming of Christ (Jeremiah 3:14-16 - 29:1-20 - 31:1-26 - Haggai 2:1-9 - Daniel 9:25-26) 
is the fact that they were the anonymous or famous actors of the narrative that enables us to 
understand God (Acts 7:44-53 - Luke 20:37-38 - Exodus 15:17-18 - 2 Samuel 7:4-11). The house of 
God is the body of Christ (2 Samuel 7:12-17 - Acts 20:28).  
17 And before Jesus of Nazareth, different angels of the holy spirit were able to intervene in 
different human communities (Daniel 4:1-18 - 5:1-30) to establish the foundations of the house of 
God (Luke 6:46-49 - 2 Timothy 2:14-21 - John 10:16).  
18 The practice of circumcision could not have existed as a ritual among Abraham's ancestors 
(Genesis 17) and was perceived by those who received it as the main symbol that distinguished 
them from other peoples (Genesis 34:14).  
19 The holy spirit was able to get impatient with Moses because his living conditions did not justify 
his disobedience to available information (Exodus 4:24-26) and the same holy spirit was patient 
with the people born in the wilderness (Joshua 5:1-8), a people whose hearts he has in priority 
circumcised (Numbers 26:63-65 - Deuteronomy 1:34-40 - 2:14-18 - 8:1-5 - 29:1-6). 
20 For the people left Egypt with flocks and the majority of the commandments of Moses were 
given at mount Sinai from the third month of their journey until the second month of the second 
year (Exodus 16:1-2 - 17:1-3 - 19:1-3 - 40:17 - Leviticus 25:1 - 26:46 - 27:34 - Numbers 1:1 - 9:1 - 
10:11-13). A journey that lasted forty years (Exodus 7:7 - Numbers 20:22-29 - 26:63-65 - 33:36-39 - 
Deuteronomy 1:1-5 - 3:18-29 - Numbers 27:12-14 - 33:47-48 - Deuteronomy 32:48-52 - 34:1-5), 
and during which the people often had livestock (Numbers 20:1,8 - 28:6 - 31:1-11). In any case, 
even during a time when they actually have livestock available, continuous morning and evening 
burnt offerings (Exodus 29:38-42,43-46) cannot be made until the tabernacle is installed (Amos 
5:21-25 - Acts 7:38-42). For this tabernacle is dismantled and carried whenever the congregation 
moves (Exodus 40:36-38 - Numbers 4:1-33,49 - 9:15-23 - Deuteronomy 1:32-33 - Numbers 33:1
49). 
21 The notion of sin is individual. Although those our genealogical ascendants influence the quality 
of the persecutions that we must endure (Exodus 34:5-7 - Numbers 14:26-32,33-35), for all the elect 
must be persecuted (2 Chronicles 32:31 - John 3:3-7 - 6:53 - Acts 14:22 - Romans 8:17 - 2 
Corinthians 4:10-11), the word child in the Hebrew Bible does not always refer to the bond of flesh 
and blood but rather to the bond of the spirit.  
22 Our children are the ones who include us in the effective chain of transmission of information 
that they use daily to effect their own accomplishments in other words those who appreciate and 
1610 
imitate our achievements (Genesis 25:21-26 - Malachi 1:1-3 - Ezekiel 37:25 - Genesis 35:10-12 - 
Luke 1:35 - John 8:38-41,42-44).  
23 Thus, Caleb was not a descendant of Abraham according to the flesh but rather the son of a 
Kenizzite (Genesis 15:18-19 - Exodus 12:37-38) and yet he inherited the promise (Genesis 17:5-8 - 
26:1-6 - Deuteronomy 1:34-38 - Numbers 32:10-13 - 34:16-19 - Joshua 14:6-14).  
24 The strange choice of the symbol that the people had to observe (Numbers 21:4-9 - John 3:14
16) to be healed after offending the holy spirit (Exodus 17:1-7 - Numbers 11:1-23,31-34 - 14:1
5,22-24 - 20:1-13 - 21:1-5) was an illustration of the fact that the optimization of our heavenly body 
is achieved by obtaining forgiveness of our sins only from those who have been wronged without 
any publicly acceptable justification. Consequently, their healings were effected by the image of 
what God the Father used to manifest their sin against God the holy spirit.  
25 It is permissible to use cunning to solve a problem fairly, but it is forbidden to design traps to 
cause the fall of a person who acts out of ignorance (Leviticus 19:14-18 - 2 Kings 10:18-28 - 1 
Kings 3:23-25 - 2 Samuel 14:1-20 - Deuteronomy 1:16-17).  
26 It was not the foreigner who was excluded from the assembly of Israel (Ezra 10:1-3 - Nehemiah 
13:23-28) but only idolatry (Ezra 9:1-2 - Nehemiah 13:29-31 - Deuteronomy 20:14-18).  
27 For the pedagogy given to Moses simply recommends avoiding being drawn into idolatry 
(Exodus 34:11-16 - Deuteronomy 7:1-9) and the holy race is not defined by genealogical ties 
(Deuteronomy 21:10-17 - Ruth 1:4,16 - 4:13-17 - Judges 21:5-15,16-22 - Joshua 8:30-35 - 13:7-13 - 
15:63 - 16:10 - 17:12-13 - 3 Rommel 2:29).  
28 Thus, God’s Israel does not triumph because of its righteousness but because of the ignorance of 
the adversary (Deuteronomy 9:1-14) that is why they must attack only their enemies (Esther 9:1
2,16 - Deuteronomy 20:1,10-12) after having offered them peace (Deuteronomy 2:24-33 - Joshua 
11:19-20). In the same way that the children of Jacob were attached to God only during certain 
periods (Judges 2), one can think that some of the nations who lived in their midst had a similar 
behavior in their relations with the holy spirit (Joshua 21:43-45 - 23:1-16).  
29 For one who is not guilty of wrongdoing is not attacked with impunity (Exodus 17:8-16 - 
Deuteronomy 25:17-19).  
30 There has always existed a part of God’s Israel which was not geographically identifiable and 
which was never under the pedagogical law chosen to welcome the incarnate Christ, that is why this 
law authorized conversions (Numbers 15:13-16,29-31 - Exodus 12:48-49 - Leviticus 24:17-22) and 
indicated that it is a sin to count the people with the sole criterion of belonging to the Israel of God 
(Exodus 30:11-15 - 2 Samuel 24:1-10 - 1 Chronicles 21:1-8 - 27:23-24 - Romans 10:6-7). [And one 
can note that the people who received the covenant of the ten commandments three months after 
their departure from the land of Egypt were not only descendants of Jacob according to the flesh. 
(Exodus 12:37-38 - 19:1-7,8-17 - Numbers 11:1-4).] 
31 But David had not been personally guilty of the numbering initiated because he was unaware of 
the exact identities of Christ and of the God of Israel so that this trial appears as a pretext for God 
the Father to judge the people (Judges 20 - Ezekiel 18:30 - Exodus 32:33).  
1611 
32 However, it was not an offense to the holy spirit to count the personnel of the army (Numbers 
1:1-3,17-19,45-49 - 26:1-4,51-53) or the members of the tribe of Levi because of their special 
function among the people (Numbers 1:50-54 - 3:14-16,39 - 26:57-62,63-65 - 1 Chronicles 23:1
3,25-27 - Numbers 8:22-26). [During the days of Moses, when the Levites had just received the 
function of transporting the sanctuary of Yahweh, the plans of which were shown to Moses because 
this structure did not exist before (5 Rommel 9:14-17 - Exodus 25:9,40 - 26:30 - 39:42-43), the 
Levites were numbered from the age of one month to know their total (Numbers 3:14-16,39 - 
26:57-62,63-65) or from the age of thirty to transport the tabernacle (Numbers 4:34-49), and they 
could serve in the different parts of the sanctuary from the age of twenty five (Numbers 8:22-26). 
And David changed the age of service of the Levites because they would no longer have to carry the 
tarbernacle built by Moses, since his son Solomon had to build a stationary house to place the ark of 
the covenant of Yahweh and also to contain the altar of the burnt offerings (1 Chronicles 23:1-3,25
27).] 
33 The only thing that must attract the eye when one observes a child of Israel is the holy spirit and 
no other fantasy (Jeremiah 9:23-26 - Leviticus 19:26-28 - Deuteronomy 14:1 - 22:11-12 - Luke 
8:43-44).  
34 Consequently, Paul’s recommendations on dress in assemblies serve only to prevent 
extravagance (1 Corinthians 11:1-16) as lust of the eyes can lead to undesirable effects (1 
Corinthians 11:17).  
35 The apostle Paul is simply trying to create a form of school of faith (Romans 10:9 - Galatians 
4:19 - 5:14 - 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 - Philippians 1:15-18 - Luke 5:36-39) for people who have not 
yet reached spiritual maturity (Luke 6:39 - Ephesians 4:7-16). And it provides for a form of 
remuneration for those who are devoted to this exercise where the need arises from lack of 
knowledge (Galatians 6:6 - Jeremiah 31:33-34), and the need to create such assemblies is also 
imposed by the beliefs of the peoples at the time of the birth and propagation of the Christian faith 
(John 16:1-3 - Acts 14:21-23,24-28 - 19:23-36).  
36 Prayer only serves to strengthen the believer in one’s attachment to the holy commandment 
(Genesis 32:3-6,7-12,13-23 - 2 Kings 18:33-37 - 19:1-5 - 2 Chronicles 32:1-8 - Nehemiah 1:1-11 - 
2:1-20 - 4:6-21 - Daniel 9:1-2,3-19 - 2 Samuel 7:18-27,28-29). This is why we must think that 
Jesus’ prayer for the fulfilment of the mission of Simon Peter (Luke 22:31-32) could have occurred 
when designing this mission (Jeremiah 1:4-5 - John 1:1-3 - 8:56-59). And in John 17 Jesus prays a 
prayer whose sole purpose is to strengthen the disciples who hear it and to make them understand 
the purpose of a prayer, since all the things he says and asks for in this prayer are things that he has 
already explained beforehand that they will happen. The apostle Paul does not think otherwise 
about prayer (Philippians 4:6-9 - 2 Thessalonians 3:1-5,6-16 - Acts 20:28-35), but he intends to 
create a form of school to perpetuate the message of Jesus (4 Rommel 6:33-35 - 11:22) so that it 
may not be easily forgotten in all future generations who will certainly transgress in different ways 
as it has been since the beginning of the history of the chosen people (Judges 2:7-11 - John 2:23
25), and that is why he chose a particular vocabulary which can be misinterpreted but whose 
misinterpretation does not cause much harm to others (2 Peter 3:15-16 - 5 Rommel 7:23-24 - 12:27
29). And the gospel of Luke does not say a different thing (Luke 18:1-8 - 5 Rommel 12:10-15), and 
the gospel of John does not say a different thing (3 Rommel 2:2 - 5 Rommel 12:16-18).  
1612 
37 In the book of God the Father we are now on the sixth day of creation (Exodus 32:32-33 - 
Ephesians 2:10) and the pedagogical laws (Galatians 3:19) were not known before Moses in the 
form of a divine commandment (Romans 2:14-21 - 4:6-12).  
38 The classification of animals that might have existed for some communities (Genesis 7:1-2 - 
8:20) was derived from the criteria established by human intelligence (Genesis 1:29 - 9:1-3). For the 
angels of the holy spirit can circumstantially confirm certain human initiatives (Exodus 18:13-27 - 
Deuteronomy 16:18-20 - 17:8-13). But these angels are not the holy spirit itself, the God of Israel 
(Acts 10:9-20 - 11:1-18 - John 1:18). 
39 The angels of the holy spirit no longer announce prophecies about events that must occur in 
future generations but rather the things on which it is possible to act now (Acts 8:26-29 - 10:1-8 - 
11:27-30 - 20:22-23 - 21:9-14).  
40 The last prophet who had this gift (Luke 16:16) symbolically performed a water baptism (Luke 
3:1-16 - John 1:25-28 - 3:22-26 - 4:1-2 - Acts 1:5 - 11:16 - 19:1-7) in order to allow people to 
publicly commit to renouncing bad deeds, that is to say, to publicly commit to cling to good deeds 
(Luke 3:21-22 - John 1:32-34). [Now what John asks the people is not to seek to do good only 
according to the quantities prescribed in the law, but to take personal initiatives for well being to 
others.] 
41 And this increased the information that the holy spirit and all the other people who know that 
this baptism took place would henceforth use to judge each person who has been publicly baptized, 
but such a commitment can also be done alone and in private.  
42 The meaning of the word baptism not being trivial (Luke 3:16 - 12:49-51 - John 1:33 - Acts 1:4
5 - 11:15-16 - 4 Rommel 7:20 - 11:16) and being absent from the conditions that are necessary to 
access eternal life (1 John 5:11-13 - Luke 10:25-28 - John 3:3-7 - 6:47-51 - 13:34-35 - 5 Rommel 
13:14-16). 
43 The water baptism of John did not call into question the existence of the tribe of Levites and the 
temple (John 1:6-8 - 1 Peter 3:21-22) which are suppressed only by the baptism of the holy spirit 
carried out by Jesus of Nazareth through the announcement of the exact identity of the God of Israel 
(John 1:29-33,34-36 - Acts 18:24-28 - 19:1-4 - Galatians 3:27 - Romans 6:3-4 - Ephesians 4:4-6 - 1 
Corinthians 1:14-31 - 1 Rommel 1:37) which brings together all human communities, individual by 
individual (Genesis 18:18-19 - Ezekiel 33:23-29 - Galatians 3:22-29). [Now the only thing that the 
holy spirit of God does is build a useful personal legacy to each person who chooses to obey him 
blindly. But in those days the Jews do not suspect that their privileged place of worship, the 
existence of which was instituted by Moses, will disappear to make them similar to the Greeks and 
to the rest of humanity regarding the method of worship of the God who created all things (John 
7:28-36). And John the Baptist did not reveal the exact identity of God because he himself did not 
know what it is (Luke 7:11-17,18-23), because the revelation of this information was reserved for 
Jesus of Nazareth (John 3:30-36 - Acts 1:4-5 - 4 Rommel 8:15). The Holy Spirit is obtained only 
once in a lifetime when one understands what must be done and does it (4 Rommel 1:19-22 - 12:12
15 - 5 Rommel 12:19-24), that is to say, when one goes to those whom one has offended in a 
publicly unjustifiable way in the past to acknowledge one's transgressions and obtain their 
forgiveness if possible, and one makes the firm inner resolution to no longer offend anyone in a 
1613 
publicly unjustifiable way. Now the water baptism initiated by John the Baptist later became a 
baptism in the name of Jesus Christ or equivalently in the name of the Father and of the Son and of 
the holy spirit, and we see that this public commitment to cling to what is right and fair according to 
the known information was made even before the acquisition of the holy spirit as it was when it was 
created (Acts 8:9-16,17-25 - 19:1-7), and it could also be done after the acquisition of the holy spirit 
(Acts 9:10-18 - 10:42-48 - 11:12-17). This is because a person can receive a water baptism of John 
or another improved form of this same public declaration (4 Rommel 12:60) every time that he 
arrives in a new community, and it is for the sole purpose of conveying the following message to all 
other members of that community: I have received knowledge of the moral code that must guide the 
voluntary actions of every person, and I believe that I possess the exact knowledge of this universal 
moral code (2 Corinthians 10:1-5 - 1 Rommel 1:36 - 4 Rommel 14:4), and therefore you do not 
need to ask yourself whether you should still teach it to me, and therefore I am ready to receive a 
proportional and merciless punishment (2 Corinthians 10:6 - 5 Rommel 5:46-47) if it is established 
that I have committed a willful transgression of this universal moral code.] 
44 The ancient Jews were saved by Jesus of Nazareth because it was explained in the Greek New 
Testament (Luke, John, Paul, Peter) that one is freed among other things from genealogical 
specificities (Numbers 18 - Deuteronomy 10:5-9 - 18:1-8 - Acts 4:32-37 - 6:1-7). An explanation 
similar to the one that created one’s faith (Exodus 4:28-31 - Luke 24:45-47 - John 20:30-31 - Acts 
3:1-26 - 5:12-20).  
45 The Gentile was saved by Jesus of Nazareth because the faith was created or solidified by the 
Hebrew Bible and the Greek scriptures (Romans 15:8-12 - Colossians 1:26-27).  
46 According to the holy scriptures, even those who doubt the possibly approximate historicity of 
the Hebrew Bible can also be saved by Jesus of Nazareth because the world around us, from which 
comes the information that determines behavior by imitation processes, is strongly impacted by the 
spread of the gospel (1 Timothy 4:10 - 5 Rommel 4:9).  
47 Because we are a new creature as soon as we choose to live by faith (2 Corinthians 5:17-21), it is 
simply appropriate to state that our sins are then forgiven or that they are carried by the process that 
allowed us to acquire faith, that is to say, Jesus of Nazareth (Isaiah 53 - Ephesians 1).  
48 Likewise, when it is stated that Jesus sits at the right hand of God in the heavenly places, it is 
simply an appropriate formula to summarize Luke 16:16. And I think that Luke 16:17 refers to the 
timeless law, the holy commandment (John 14:15 - 15:12,17), because it is easy to see that Moses' 
commandments were a form of pedagogy (4 Rommel 7:13-20,21-24 - 3 Rommel 2:28-29,30-32), 
and also because Jesus speaks with parables (4 Rommel 8:15 - 5 Rommel 7:10-15).  
49 By proclaiming themselves different, they oppose the holy spirit and in addition they take away 
from the holy spirit those whom they manage to convince by usurping the place of Jesus Christ in 
their hearts.  
50 There is fulfillment of Exodus 19:4-6 - Numbers 12:1-2 - 16:1-3. And this could not be achieved 
during the time of the pedagogy.  
51 Now it is no longer possible to recognize, according to their paternal houses, the ten lost tribes (2 
Kings 17:1-23 - 1 Chronicles 5:10,18-26). And the promised land will therefore be shared equally 
1614 
among the members of the Israel of God (Ezekiel 47:13-23 - Zechariah 2:1-5,10-13 - Joel 2:28-32 - 
Luke 24:45-47 - Acts 2:16-38 - Ephesians 2:13-22). 
52 What is important is the commandment of Christ and not the various feasts based on the sighting 
of the moon [the only means available for measuring time on a large scale and demarcating months 
and seasons] which are instituted in the pedagogical law (1 Chronicles 23:27-32 - Ezekiel 46:1-3 - 
Colossians 2:16-23).  
53 Thus, even the celebration of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth serves only to periodically remind 
future generations and those who tend to forget it of the Good News, the dispute over the precise 
date of the celebration having no significance and being akin to numerology which is a form of 
idolatry.

1 The pedagogy initiated through Moses (Isaiah 1:2-3 - 2 Corinthians 3:12-18), second part.  
2 The following things happened after the destruction of their temple (Deuteronomy 13 - John 9:28
29).  
3 No (Leviticus 13:40-45 - 14:34-47 - 21:16-24 - 23:34-38,39-44 - Numbers 5:17 - 6:1-8,9-12,13
18 - 10:1-10 - 15:37-41 - Deuteronomy 16:1-3 - 24:8 - Exodus 31:12-18 - Numbers 9:1-14 - 2 
Chronicles 30:1-3,13-21,22-27 - John 4:22).  
4 There are specific corners of our beard that we must not shave (Leviticus 19:27) so as not to 
offend the creator of heaven and earth. This is encoded in the Oral Law and as a precautionary 
principle we sometimes prefer not even to shave.  
5 We do not even speak his name because of all the respect we have for him (Exodus 3:14 - 34:14). 
And he promised us that he will subjugate the rest of mankind to our will when he sends the lion 
from the tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:9-10). Can a lion become a lamb (John 1:35-36).  
6 We do not eat pork. The promised land is for us and our children, and we do not want those who 
refuse to give the tithe to the tribe of Levi and who refuse that we teach them the will of the 
supreme being that is encoded in the nuances of biblical Hebrew (Deuteronomy 4:39).  
7 The throne of David must be strengthened forever (Psalms 89 - 2 Chronicles 13:1-12) by a person 
who will forever preserve the grace of God (1 Chronicles 17 - Psalms 132). 
8 And it is not Solomon (1 Kings 11:9-13) because the temple is currently destroyed (2 Samuel 7:16 - 1 Chronicles 17:14). For this promise of God is not yet fulfilled despite the fact that Solomon 
actually built a house for Yahweh (1 Kings 2:1-4 - 6:11-13 - 8:25 - 9:1-9 - 11:29-39 - 15:1-5 - 2 
Chronicles 7:11-22 - 2 Kings 8:16-19 - 2 Chronicles 21) because this house was destroyed and the 
people of the land of Judah were sent into exile. And according to the prophecy of the prophet 
Jeremiah there has been a return of the exiles, perhaps even from the other ten tribes of Israel who 
were previously scattered elsewhere at the ends of the earth. And then the temple was rebuilt in the 
days of Ezra and Nehemiah and Zechariah and Haggai, but there was never again a king in Israel to 
sit on the throne of David (Nehemiah 6:1-13). No legitimate heir is established today.  
1615 
9 But it could not be this Immanuel (1 Peter 1:16-21 - Isaiah 7:1-16 - Romans 4:17) whose name 
means 'God is with us' (Isaiah 8:5-10), and who is also call Jesus (Luke 1:26-35) whose name 
means 'salvation of God'. He has been announced for the house of David (Isaiah 7:13-16), namely 
to all the people who carry the inheritance of David, because they were in fear of being completely 
eradicated by the enemy (1 Rommel 3:14-15) [therefore it is not necessary that the fulfillment of 
this prophecy be directly related to the outcome of the ongoing battle]. And he has been announced 
to a king who is not even loved by God (2 Chronicles 28), and none of the identities of his parents 
is revealed, and no aspect of his function in the world is revealed.  
10 However, being jewish does not mean practicing a religion. It is a community united by the same 
universal values which are transmitted through the maternal womb (Genesis 41:38-45 - 46:20 - 
48:5-6 - 49:22-26 - Numbers 34:13-15 - Ezekiel 47:13 - 1 Kings 14:21,31 - 2 Chronicles 12:13) and 
yet open to the conversions of strangers (Joshua 8:32-35 - Esther 8:17 - Isaiah 56). 
11 But they cannot hope to incorporate the prestigious hereditary tribe of the Levites (Deuteronomy 
18:1-2) which has a special connection with God through paternal blood in order to frequently offer 
to God his favorite food, namely the blood and fat of healthy animals. And to explain the law to the 
people and to judge difficult issues (Deuteronomy 15:19-23 - 17:1-13 - Nehemiah 8:6-12).  
12 We did not write this book which would have been translated into Greek before the coming of 
Jesus of Nazareth, we also received it but these are our traditions and the tradition must remain alive 
like the God who is described there (Numbers 14:28) while this Jesus of Nazareth died without 
fulfilling the prophecies on the glorification of the jewish people. And anyway, where is the proof 
that he actually existed.  
13 We want to build the house of God that the rest of the world will envy, we will cook meats in it 
(Exodus 18:11-12 - 20:24-26 - 1 Kings 19:21 - Zechariah 14:20-21 - Ezekiel 46:19-24). The burnt 
offerings are not eaten (Exodus 29:15-18 - Leviticus 1 - 1 Kings 3:4 - 2 Chronicles 1:1-6 - 29:25
31). But peace offerings and many categories of sin offerings, including transgress offerings when 
another human is directly offended by the sin, these are eaten (Exodus 29:19-22,31-34 - Leviticus 
7:28-38 - 10:1-7,16-20 - 1 Kings 8:4-5,62-64 - 2 Chronicles 5:5-7 - 7:4-7 - 29:32-36). 
14 The fat is burned and the blood is shed, and the people eat the remainder of the flesh after having 
given good portions to the members of the hereditary tribe of Levi while God will be hidden behind 
the veil (Deuteronomy 12:1-14,15-18 - 14:22-29 - 15:19-23) where he will be met once a year by a 
high priest descendant of Aaron (Exodus 30:9-10), on the occasion of a special ceremony which 
marks the fact that it is impossible for the people to be without sin (Leviticus 16 - 1 Rommel 3:35).  
15 But it is not because the very existence of the pedagogical law is a sin (Exodus 29:1-14 - 
Leviticus 8:13-17 - 4 Rommel 7:16-18) which gives a privileged position to the family tree of 
Aaron and Levi and which separates into two parts the Israel of God (Isaiah 8:13-18 - Micah 5:1-4 - 
John 11:50-52).  
16 No willful transgression that cannot be justified by any circumstantial constraint is forgivable 
(Numbers 15:22-31) but we know the difference between on the one hand the sins committed by 
involuntary transgressing the commandments concerning the particular rituals that are required in 
the written law (Leviticus 4).  
1616 
17 And in this situation something is lost if the transgression was committed by the whole assembly 
or by the descendant of Aaron who was anointed to serve as high priest (Leviticus 4:7,18 - 6:30). 
And the flesh of the victim is even burned with its excrement at the place where rubbish is thrown, 
far from the presence of Yahweh who is supposed to be in the sanctuary of the tent of meeting 
(Leviticus 4:10-12,20-21).  
18 And if this particular type of transgression [which concerns the particular rituals that are required 
in the written law] is not committed by one of these two similar categories of culprits, then the 
victim can be eaten (Leviticus 4:25,30,34 - 6:24-30 - 10:8-18). [Now Ezekiel has indicated that 
there will be another ritual in the future for this particular type of unintentional transgression 
(Ezekiel 45:18-20)] 
19 And on the other hand the sins committed by inflicting harm on someone else with a guilty 
justification and in this situation we find the love of God only by obtaining the forgiveness of those 
whom we have offended and by performing guilt offerings [which is a transgress offering, a 
category of sin offerings]. There is no other way (Leviticus 5:1,4,14-16 - 6:1-7 - Numbers 5:5-10 - 
Hosea 6:6 - Proverbs 21:3 - Psalms 51:16-17 - Ezekiel 18:1-32 - 33:11-20 - Isaiah 1:10-20 - 57:15
21 - 4 Rommel 6:24). And this is the reason why we must recognize a benefit not only by thanking 
God, but also by recognizing the merit of the person whom God has to use to perform that benefit 
(Luke 17:11-19). [At the time of the construction of the temple of Ezekiel, which is supposed to 
exist after the coming of the prince described in his book, there will always be a distinction between 
the voluntary actions that a person does on his own initiative and the voluntary actions that this 
person does because of an external constraint (Ezekiel 46:12). And there will also be a distinction 
between the two types of transgressions which are on the one hand voluntary actions designed to 
offend other persons without having publicly acceptable justifications in the heart (and the apostle 
Paul also speaks of this type of transgression which becomes the only type of transgression in the 
gospel of Jesus - 1 Corinthians 5:1-5 - 6:1-3), and on the other hand the involuntary transgressions 
that do not directly offend other persons and concern only the particular rituals that are required in 
the written law (and the apostle Paul also speaks of this type of transgression which can become 
simply a divergence between sincere personal convictions in the gospel of Jesus - 1 Corinthians 3:9
15 - 4:1-6 - Acts 13:1-4 - 15:35-41 - Romans 14:1-5,6-13 - John 3:8), since this distinction is made 
in the names given to these two types of sins (Ezekiel 46:20). The temple of Ezekiel should be built 
to accommodate the one who is designated as the prince, and who will be like a king and like a 
priest and like God (1 Rommel 3:49). And we can notice that the guilt offering that Yahweh 
required of the friends of Job to be forgiven for having accused Job without justification is a burnt 
offering (Job 42:7-8) and therefore it is not meant to be eaten like the guilt offering required in the 
law given by Moses to the children of Israel. We must then understand that there is no contradiction 
because Job does not belong to the tribes of Israel (3 Rommel 1:27 - Micah 6:3-5,6-8), and the 
name Yahweh simply designates the holy spirit of Elohim (3 Rommel 1:2,8 - Malachi 1:4-5,11-14 - 
2:17) and appears in this story because it is Moses who supposedly rewrote the story of Job as he 
also wrote the story of Balaam (Numbers 22:18) who was a prophet not coming from the tribes of 
Israel (Numbers 22:1-8). Elohim is the one who causes all things to happen, and Yahweh the holy 
spirit of Elohim has said to Moses that he is also Elohim and the only Elohim (Deuteronomy 4:39). 
Now the only thing that the holy spirit of Elohim does is build a useful personal legacy to each 
person who chooses to obey him blindly, and Jesus of Nazareth has had the best place because he 
1617 
never had anything to reproach himself for in the relationship between what he actually knew and 
why he was doing what he was doing (Philippians 2:8-11). And Jesus is the only person to have 
possessed the special gift of forgiving the sins of others (4 Rommel 5:8-9) because of his own 
nature (John 3:31-36 - 1 Corinthians 12:4-13 - 4 Rommel 2:62-65), because he was not an ordinary 
man (Ezekiel 43:1-4 - 44:1-3 - 46:8-9 - 47:1-6). Jesus has come into the world in order to teach all 
peoples the exact knowledge of the God of the concept of justice who is the only true God (Genesis 
49:10 - John 11:45-52).]  
20 The word transgression can refer only to sins that directly offend another human being or more 
generally any sin concerning any commandment of Yahweh. Because identical words are used to 
designate things having a certain connection and then the exact meaning depends on the context. 
21 After Moses who knew God face to face (Exodus 33:7-11 - Deuteronomy 34:9-12), Ezekiel is 
said to have been the only prophet who gave new laws for the people (Ezekiel 40–48).  
22 And these laws contradict the architectural teachings of Moses concerning the structure of the 
temple which is the place of worship (Exodus 26:1-15 - Ezekiel 44:1-2 - 48:29-35 - John 4:22).  
23 And also concerning the quantities of sacrifices that must be offered to Yahweh alone (Ezekiel 
45–46 - Numbers 28–29 - 4 Rommel 13), the obligatory part of burnt offerings [and burnt offerings 
are not eaten]. But the laws concerning the offerings that are eaten have not been changed 
(Leviticus 2:1-16 - 3:1-17 - 7:1-10 - 1 Samuel 2:12-17,27-29 - Ezekiel 44:15-16).  
24 It is for us to be at the service of the only God who created everything and to whom everything 
belongs (Job 41:11 - Psalms 50:1-15 - Zechariah 7:1-10).  
25 But if we have to choose between Moses and Ezekiel then we prefer to choose Moses because 
this God has no sense of humor (Genesis 25:21-23,28-34 - 27:1-25 - 29:15-25 - Exodus 20:22-23 - 
32:1-14 - 29:42-46 - 34:27-28 - Deuteronomy 10:8-9 - 31:19-27), contrary to the God of other 
prophets (1 Kings 8:9,25-30 - Ezekiel 43:6-12 - 1 Kings 22:1-23) and even the God of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ (Luke 7:1-9 - John 11:55-57 - 12:9-13,17-19).  
26 We must not add or subtract from the commandments given by Moses (Deuteronomy 4:1-2 - 
12:32 - Isaiah 8:12-20), not for eternity but until the coming of someone who is immortal and who 
will teach us an additional message from God (Deuteronomy 18:18-20 - Jeremiah 31:31-34 - John 
8:23-25).  
27 God insists that there be no mixing between the heritages of the different paternal tribes of Israel 
(Numbers 36 - Ezekiel 46:16-18 - 48:1-29) this is why we must find the lost tribes and identify their 
paternal tribes (Jeremiah 23:5-8). 
28 Some of God’s people were scattered several centuries ago among the nations (2 Kings 17:1-23 - 
1 Chronicles 5:10,18-26) but honesty and integrity is our motto, they will be found and gathered 
together in the promised land whose limits we know (Ezekiel 47:13-23). And we know all this 
because it is written in the Bible.  
29 And the scattered tribes did not return from exile at the same time as the tribe of Judah when the 
second temple was built after the destruction of that of Solomon, we are certain of it (2 Kings 25:1
22 - Jeremiah 3:1-16 - 30:1-24 - Ezekiel 20:27-44 - 34:11-24 - 37:21-28 - 3 Rommel 2:18).  
1618 
30 In the incomprehensible nature of their love for God or rather of the promises they hope to fulfill 
(Zechariah 14:16-21), it would not be surprising if they had a dubious interpretation of David’s 
words (Psalms 139:21-24) and try to apply this biblical passage to those who suggest them not to 
seek to identify their brothers and sisters on the face of the earth (Exodus 22:31 - Deuteronomy 
14:21 - 23:19-20 - Galatians 3:22 - John 9:39-41).  
31 Because the final teaching is that we are all brothers and sisters, whether one is a master or a 
slave (Acts 10:24-43).  
32 And the holy spirit who distributes different gifts to different people (Acts 19:1-20 - 1 
Corinthians 12:4-13) considers each person according to the information available and actually 
understood (Romans 10:1-4 - John 15:22-27 - Job 35:1-8).  
33 But sins committed in ignorance of the knowledge of the true God of Israel are to be 
compensated one way or another (Psalms 119:75 - 2 Timothy 2:13 - Lamentations 3:21-41 - 
Ecclesiastes 11:9-10 - 12:1-7 - 1 Peter 5:6-9). 
4 Rommel 8  
1 How to offend or please the holy spirit (John 5:39-40 - Jeremiah 9:23-24), first part. 
2 God’s love means that he will give a place, possibly anonymously (Galatians 6:7-8 - Ecclesiastes 
9:13-15), to our heavenly body (Genesis 6:5-8 - 8:18-22).  
3 And this does not always translate into a long life (Luke 9:7-9 - 2 Chronicles 34:1-2 - 2 Samuel 
5:4-5) but it is often the case (2 Peter 3:9,15).  
4 The substance of biblical narratives is to highlight different ways of being guilty or righteous 
towards the holy spirit and the message is the same: one does not overcome by force but by the 
spirit (2 Samuel 17:1-14 - 1 Samuel 2:9-10 - Isaiah 8:5-10,11-13). [Ben-hadad the king of Syria 
relied solely on his strength twice, and it was a failure (1 Kings 20:1-13,21-30). And then he had 
more success when he chose the way of the spirit (1 Kings 20:31-34). We can also notice that 
Nahash the Ammonite was a little arrogant in his behavior (1 Samuel 11:1-4,5-10,11-15).]  
5 The following concerns the notion of truth (John 18:38).  
6 Not all those who simulate transparency in their lives are Israel (2 Corinthians 11:14). There are 
remnants among Jacob and remnants among those who were never Jacob, and both form the Israel 
of God (Isaiah 44:1-6).  
7 A semantic theory of truth holds that truth is a property of sentences and if I affirm that truth is a 
relative notion, it is because there are two semantics which are not necessarily independent. 
8 On the one hand there is the meaning of the words in a sentence, and on the other hand there is the 
meaning of a sentence in the particular context of a pair (sender - receiver). [The meaning of the 
same statement by Jesus may depend on the people to whom he gives this information (John 8:21
22 - 13:33-36), and a same sentence does not necessarily have the same meaning when it is said by 
two different persons since one can think that Abraham was not doubting unlike Sarah (Genesis 
17:15-18 - 18:9-14 - Romans 4:19-22).] 
1619 
9 There may therefore be situations where the truth of a statement can only be determined by the 
intentions of the author so that there may be several truths and several lies, each of the words truth 
and lie then referring not not to unique possibilities but to sets.  
10 Thus, to speak the truth only means to express oneself under the influence of the holy spirit, in 
other words to have in the heart good intentions in relation to arbitrarily chosen strangers in society.  
11 This is the context of the proposition P which states that truth is the light of human beings. 
12 Light is the means by which we can achieve our goals with satisfaction, without this being 
followed by any unpleasant surprise through cause and effect relationships.  
13 It should be noted that everything a person does at any time is to achieve a specific goal which is 
sometimes only known to that person. 
14 I am thirsty and I want to soothe this feeling. I want to eliminate a person to take advantage of 
certain circumstances in such and such a way. I hope to go to a paradise which perhaps does not 
exist. 
15 Even Jesus of Nazareth is not God the holy spirit who is the holy one of Israel (John 12:44-45). 
Now Jesus of Nazareth speaks with parables (Luke 6:29 - 8:5-8,9-15 - 14:34-35 - 22:35-38 - John 
6:35-36 - 10:6-7 - 12:32-36 - 13:10-11 - 16:25-29) because he interacts with people who trust in the 
law of Moses (Luke 6:6-11) in order to make them understand the exact definition of eternal life 
(John 11:21-27) and the only way to make a comfortable place in it (John 14:1-4,6-10), and those 
people should understand it by becoming fully aware of all the implications of the fact that he has 
risen from the dead (Luke 9:18-22,44-45 - John 20:8-9) and that the commandment concerning the 
sabbath day was given to them by Moses only so that Jesus may come to demonstrate the power of 
the holy spirit (4 Rommel 6:3 - 3 Rommel 2:12). And Jesus also speaks in parable with the aim of 
giving a special place in eternal life to the eleven disciples whom he has chosen (Luke 8:9-11 - 
22:24-29), and they are eleven because it is necessary to exclude Judas who separated from the 
others when he left to perform the betrayal that allowed the Jewish leaders to arrest Jesus without 
putting themselves in danger (Luke 19:47-48 - 22:1-6,45-54 - John 11:55-57 - 12:9-13,17-19 - 18:1
13), and it is only after the Holy Spirit had come into the world that these eleven disciples truly 
understood all the words of Jesus (Acts 1:4-8 - 2:14-40) while a twelfth disciple understood the 
meaning of life and also the words of Jesus to which he had been exposed (Acts 1:12-26 - 2:1-4), 
and the apostle Paul also understood the meaning of life without having met Jesus in the flesh (Acts 
9:1-27 - 22:1-21). The apostles have understood everything with regard to the implementation of 
faith, and the understanding of Peter was gradual and continued even after the day of Pentecost, and 
it seems to me to understanding of Paul was total from the time of his miraculous conversion (Acts 
22:12-21), but none of them have understood everything with regard to the exact definition of 
eternal life and that is why they had strange discussions (Acts 15:1-32 - 17:1-7,8-14 - 28:17-24,25
29). [Now it is not normal for a person to express himself in parables if the necessity is not imposed 
by the context in which he finds himself (Luke 8:16 - 11:33). The apostle Paul intends to create a 
form of school to perpetuate the message of Jesus (4 Rommel 6:33-35 - 11:22) so that it may not be 
easily forgotten in all future generations who will certainly transgress in different ways as it has 
been since the beginning of the history of the chosen people (Judges 2:7-11 - John 2:23-25), and 
that is why he chooses to express himself in an indirect way (2 Corinthians 12:15-16 - 1 Timothy 
1620 
2:5-8 - Colossians 4:2-4 - Ephesians 2:10). As for the apostles Peter and John in the two epistles of 
Peter and in the first epistle of John, they do not express themselves indirectly but they say what 
they know with their own words which come from the bottom of their heart according to the context 
in which they find themselves.] 
16 And we see that David can seek a confirmation of an information that he already knows, as is the 
case with the angels of Yahweh (1 Samuel 17:20-30 - Zechariah 4:1-5,11-14). [Now concerning 
David he does not ask the same question to the same person, and concerning God he is God and he 
probes hearts (Genesis 4:9-10 - John 4:15-19).]  
17 The father of all creation (Jeremiah 10:11-16 - 1 Corinthians 8:5-6), and the light of the world 
(John 8:12 - 18:37), and the father of the children of Israel and of Jesus of Nazareth (Jeremiah 10:1
10 - 1 John 2:15-17). God the Father and God the Son and God the holy spirit. 
4 Rommel 9  
1 How to offend or please the holy spirit (John 5:39-40 - Jeremiah 9:23-24), second part: Selected 
pieces. 
2 Joab strikes Absalom (2 Samuel 18:9-15) whom he brought back to the king (2 Samuel 14:1,18
21) and who rebelled after burning his field (2 Samuel 14:28-33). 
3 Without involving the holy spirit in his motives, Naboth refuses a transaction offered to him 
honestly and in the light of day (1 Kings 21:1-3) by a king whom he is supposed to obey (1 Samuel 
8).  
4 Yet he must have known that the commandments of Yahweh (Numbers 36:6-9 - Ezekiel 47:13
14,21-23) are much more about the quality of intentions than actions, since in his time the 
tabernacle of Moses was already replaced by the house built by Solomon. For Solomon is the third 
king of Israel and the last to reign over the twelve tribes united, before the separation of the people 
into two kingdoms.   
5 And with her husband’s permission, Jezebel decides to take justice by dark ways by inciting 
others to offend the holy spirit (1 Kings 21:4-23). 
6 Simeon and Levi acted with anger (Genesis 34:13-31) and did not forgive those who wished to 
repent (Genesis 34:1-12). 
7 For they could have simply rejected their proposal and demanded reparation (Deuteronomy 
22:28-29 - Genesis 49:5-7). 
8 She has not previously offended him in any way on her own initiative, and yet Judah makes a 
promise to his daughter in law without any sincerity when he is under no obligation to do so. 
Therefore he will have to suffer the consequences (Genesis 38:1-26).  
9 Jeroboam abandoned the members of the tribe of Levi (Deuteronomy 10:8-9) by granting their 
livelihood to others and led the people away from the holy spirit by appointing new gods (1 Kings 
12:26-31 - 2 Chronicles 11:1-12,13-17 - 1 Kings 14:1-16). He could have caused to build an 
equivalent of the tabernacle of Moses and used the Levites as priests [At the beginning of the reign 
1621 
of Solomon the son of David, there were at least two distinct places that deserved to be holy: the 
location of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the location of the tabernacle that Moses had 
built in the wilderness], or he could have done nothing and trusted Yahweh enough as Abraham did 
(Genesis 15:6 - 1 Kings 11:29-39).  
10 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and Sancherib king of Assyria, and Haman servant of king 
Ahasuerus, each wanted to give himself more importance than the holy spirit (Daniel 4:30 - 2 Kings 
19:9-13 - Esther 3:1-5,6-11, 5:9-14) who is the true God of Israel (Daniel 4:31-37 - 2 Kings 19:17
28 - Esther 6).  
11 Thus, Solomon did not sin against the holy spirit by the fact that he exercised freedom from the 
commandments of Moses (Deuteronomy 17:14-20 - 1 Kings 11:1-2 - Leviticus 10:16-20) but 
precisely by the acts of idolatry that he actually committed (1 Kings 11:3-10). 
12 Although David will continue to live through Solomon not only through the teachings which he 
transmitted directly to him and which will actually be used, but also through the family tree to a 
lesser extent since each is responsible for his own sin.  
13 Solomon who was not directly offended by Shimei (1 Kings 2:8-9 - 2 Samuel 16:5-12 - 19:15
23) made a proposal to him which he accepted (1 Kings 2:36-38) and which he could not keep (1 
Kings 2:39-46).  
14 Thus, we do not see a direct offense from Amalek (Deuteronomy 25:17-19) towards Saul when 
the angel sends him to destroy this people (1 Samuel 15:1-3) but this does not mean that such a 
widespread offense did not exist against Saul or Israel. 
15 It must be admitted that the scriptures do not specify every detail known to each stakeholder in 
every context. 
16 And that there has never been any difference between those who practice righteousness and 
integrity according to the information at their disposal, whatever be the peculiarities of the 
community in which they evolve (Jeremiah 27:1-22 - 43:1-13 - 2 Kings 5:1-18 - 2 Chronicles 
35:20-23 - Ephesians 3). 
17 On the one hand a pharaoh loved by God welcomed Jacob (Genesis 47:1-11) and others who was 
less loved did not pass on to future generations an admirable inheritance (Exodus 1:7-10 - 2:23-25 - 
3:16-22 - 12:40-41 – 14:16-18).  
18 On the other hand God loved king David (1 Chronicles 22) and he was angry with some of his 
descendants according to the flesh (2 Chronicles 36).

because they recognized the unusual assets of the adversary (1 Samuel 17:4-7,24).  
4 And David, less impressive in appearance, volunteered to fight the enemy because he remembered 
confronting and defeating the lion and bear in a combination of circumstances (1 Samuel 17:33-37).  
5 Sin is only in what you desire through your actions based on what you know.  
6 She saves his life with sincerity (1 Samuel 18:6-9,22-29 - 19:9-18) and he remembers it (2 Samuel 
3:14-16).  
7 He fears for his life (1 Samuel 21:10-12) and does not offend anyone (1 Samuel 21:13-15).  
8 Elsewhere he fears for his life and leaves it up to God to decide on a parameter that he cannot 
control (1 Samuel 22:20-23).  
9 He is offended to have worked without pay (1 Samuel 25:14-17,21-22) but revenge belongs to 
God (1 Samuel 25:25-44).  
10 It was the all-powerful God of David, whose identity is still unknown, who made Saul the king 
of Israel (1 Samuel 24:1-10 - 26:7-12 - 27:1-4 - Exodus 9:15-16).  
11 Furthermore, the Amalekite has offended the holy spirit (2 Samuel 1:1-10) and David is in a 
position to exercise justice against him who struck down a man for his own glory (2 Samuel 1:13
16). 
12 Like any normal human being, the son of Saul was not born with the holy spirit but he agrees to 
make peace (2 Samuel 3:9-16).  
13 This is why David, who is in a position to do so, exercises justice against those who have struck 
a man for their own glory (2 Samuel 4:5-12).  
14 Jonathan showed kindness to David (1 Samuel 20) and he remembers it (2 Samuel 9).  
15 However, like Isaac and Esau (Malachi 1:2-3) or Amon and Josiah (2 Chronicles 33:21-25 - 
34:1-2), the son according to Jonathan’s flesh is not also his spiritual son since he does not imitate 
the behavior of Jonathan (2 Samuel 16:1-4).  
16 And faced with new information whose relevance he cannot determine, David acts in real time 
with fairness (2 Samuel 19:24-30 - 1 Samuel 8).  
17 David found himself in a complicated situation because everyone must commit sins and it is not 
a stranger who was offended (2 Samuel 13:11-22). 
18 And he is convinced by Joab to let return Absalom (2 Samuel 14:21-24,32-33) who did not 
personally offend David. 
19 David wants to be grateful but the recipients are mistaken, and rather than acknowledge their 
mistake they choose to make war on him (2 Samuel 10:1-7). 
20 And they act out of pride for they know that to forgive does not mean to forget but rather to take 
precautions in the future (2 Samuel 16:20-23). [David and Joab and Amasa are of the same family 
(1 Chronicles 2:13-17), and Amasa was among David's enemies (2 Samuel 17:25) and it is unlikely 
1623 
that this was an appearance (2 Samuel 15:32-34). And it is not a contradiction if David wants to 
entrust new responsibilities to Amasa (2 Samuel 19:11-14) because David does not act as a man but 
as a king who wishes to reign over the entire population previously divided into two camps and who 
is in a context where he cannot repel all his former enemies]  
21 Joab takes revenge in peacetime (2 Samuel 3:17-39) for an unfortunate event that occurred 
during the war (2 Samuel 2:17-28). 
22 And in addition he disobeys king David who asks him to capture Absalom alive (2 Samuel 18:1
5,10-14).  
23 Then David wants to take away his title of leader of the army (1 Chronicles 11:4-6 - 2 Samuel 
19:11-13) and he opposes it by striking the one who did not offend him directly (2 Samuel 20:4-10), 
except by the fact that they were both from the same family and were the leaders of the two 
opposing armies during Absalom's rebellion.  
24 Therefore this information known to David must be transmitted to one who serves the same God 
and who is supposed to lead the same people (1 Kings 2:5-6). 
25 David himself was not an incarnation of Christ (1 Kings 15:5) but merely his spiritual father 
(Luke 20:41-44). 
26 And David’s work continuously shines before God because it is designed to be the basis of the 
teachings of God’s only begotten son, the light of the world.

1 Theological vocabulary (Luke 1:31-33 - John 8:51), first part: Generalities. 
2 Any opinion or explanation (Proverbs 18:2) is always from someone, and we should trust no one 
(Isaiah 2:22 - 1 Thessalonians 5:19-22).  
3 In this biblical sentence (Proverbs 18:2) it is not the fact of wanting to reveal one's thoughts that is 
criticized but rather the possibility of doing so without being based on any conviction resulting from 
a preliminary analysis of at least one aspect of the problem (Romans 14:5). 
4 For it must be understood that one who is motivated by the holy spirit cannot be a fool.  
5 And if someone knows absolutely nothing about a subject, is it impossible to have an intimate 
conviction without calmly listening to the different points of view available (Proverbs 12:15).  
6 Words and phrases may have different meanings when used in different sentences (Genesis 15:13
16 - Exodus 12:35-41 - John 8:33 - Genesis 2:1-3 - Leviticus 25:8-10 - Daniel 9:21-26).  
7 And the actual duration of the stay of the children of Israel in Egypt may be different (Exodus 
6:16-20 - 12:40-41). Either because the count was made from the time Joseph was sold, or because 
after the miracles that were performed there to free the children of Jacob, the word Egypt is more 
generally used to designate a population or even a territory where beliefs are incompatible with the 
one true God. And in this latter case it is necessary to count from the moment of Isaac's birth, or 
from the moment when the promise was made to Abraham as indicated by the apostle Paul 
1624 
(Galatians 3:15-17). For Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed in the days of Abraham (Genesis 
18:20-26) but their names continued to be used to designate peoples with similar practices 
(Deuteronomy 32:32 - Isaiah 1:1-2,9-10).  
8 Otherwise how to understand on the one hand that no misfortune happens to the just (Proverbs 
12:21) when it is said that Job was just (Job 1).  
9 And on the other hand that misfortune often happens to the just who will always be delivered 
(Psalms 34:11-22) when John the Baptist is said to have had his head cut off (Luke 9:7-9).  
10 Thus it must be admitted that the righteous may undergo very difficult trials but will always see 
in each situation an opportunity to serve the creator through the spirit according to all the complex 
information that is accessible while the wicked cannot reach the fullness of the heart because he 
continually experiences desires that offend the spirit (Proverbs 12:21). 
11 Moreover, the certain deliverance of the righteous (Psalms 34) does not necessarily concern 
physical life but will always be accomplished in eternal life, possibly anonymously (John 12:24
26).  
12 So we who are disciples of Jesus Christ are wise (Proverbs 8:1-21 - 1 Corinthians 1:30-31) but 
our wisdom is not that of the world (Proverbs 3:7 - Isaiah 5:21).  
13 A single reality can be described by several truths, in other words a single truth can have several 
facets (Exodus 20:11 - Deuteronomy 5:15 - Numbers 13:1-3 - Deuteronomy 1:19-24 - 1 Samuel 
10:9-12 - 19:18-24).  
14 In addition, the notion of responsibility allows the free use of different names to designate the 
author of a single achievement (Luke 10:16).  
15 The author of the establishment of judges assigned to this task among the children of Israel 
(Exodus 18:13-27 - Deuteronomy 1:1-17 - 16:18-20). Or the authors of the losses that have 
occurred during a conflict (2 Samuel 21:15-22 - 1 Chronicles 20:4-8). Or the author of the making 
of the ark of testimony (Exodus 31:1-11 - 38:22 - 39:42-43 - Deuteronomy 10:3-5). Or the author of 
the writings of the ten words on the tablets of stone, the other two tablets that were not broken after 
the first two tablets had been broken (4 Rommel 6:13), for he who acts under the influence of the 
spirit of God performs the acts of God (Luke 3:21-22 - 1 Chronicles 28:19 - 2 Chronicles 20:14-15 - 
24:19-21 - Judges 20:27-28). And also the authors of the death of Jesus of Nazareth (Luke 18:31-34 - John 18:28-32 - 19:6-11,12-16).   
16 In the holy scriptures different realities are called by the same name only because of the 
particular connection between their contextual nature (Job 10:4 - 1 Samuel 16:6-7). [We can speak 
of Manasseh to designate all the individuals whose paternal genealogies contain this child of Jacob, 
and it is also possible to speak thus of Machir who is the first son of Manasseh (Joshua 17:1), and 
there is also Sodom and Gomorrah which were destroyed in the days of Abraham (Genesis 18:20
26) but their names continued to be used to designate peoples with similar practices (Deuteronomy 
32:32 - Isaiah 1:1-2,9-10).]  
17 As a first example, the word God which refers to a hidden power (Exodus 7:1) can indifferently 
refer to the author of all creation (Genesis 1:1), or to his only begotten Son who has a different 
1625 
identity (John 1:1-4 - 1 Timothy 2:5), or to his holy spirit who alone can secure us a place in eternal 
life (1 Chronicles 28:19 - 2 Chronicles 20:14-15 - 24:19-21 - Judges 20:27-28).   
18 Thus, an unchanging God announces the arrival of the messenger of a new covenant who is also 
called God (Malachi 3:1-6 - Isaiah 40:1-5,6-9 - John 1:1).  
19 As a second example, all those who cling to the holy spirit receive a firstborn position and obtain 
therefore an eternal inheritance (Exodus 4:22 - Psalms 89:26-28,35-37 - Jeremiah 31:9 - John 1:9). 
And Jesus of Nazareth is the first born par excellence (Psalms 45:6-7).   
20 As a third example, the word Israel sometimes refers to the twelve tribes who have come from 
Jacob and who are finally dispersed after Jesus of Nazareth (Exodus 12:47-51 - Leviticus 19:33-37 - 
24:22 - Joshua 1 - Isaiah 56:1-8). And some other times it is all the Israel of God which contains 
more than Jacob (Genesis 17:1-5 - 32:28 - Joshua 14:14 - Micah 5:1-4 - Romans 9:6-8 - Ezekiel 
47:21-23 - Romans 2:28-29).   
21 As a fourth example, the Levites of the New Covenant (Malachi 3:1-6 - Jeremiah 31:31-37) are 
no longer determined by the family tree (Deuteronomy 10:8-9 - 18:1-8 - Acts 4:31-37) but all 
imitators of the apostle Paul, who is himself from the tribe of Benjamin (Philippians 3:4-11), for 
whom nothing is forbidden except to have in the heart evil intentions in relation to strangers 
arbitrarily chosen in society (Exodus 19:5-6 - 1 Corinthians 9:14-19 - 11:1 - Luke 17:10).  
22 The apostle Paul uses all the information of the context in which he evolves and wants to create 
a form of school accordingly (1 Timothy 2:12 - Galatians 4:1-2 - 1 Corinthians 3:1-2 - Galatians 
3:28) to teach people to move away from all forms of idolatry and to cling only to the holy spirit 
(Judges 4:1-10 - 2 Chronicles 34:18-28 - Isaiah 29:13 - John 13:34-35 - 1 Peter 1:22-25 - 2 
Corinthians 10:3-6). The message that is taught is unique, it is the message of Jesus of Nazareth (3 
Rommel 2:19-21). 
23 As a fifth example the words life and death sometimes refer to the life and death of the physical 
body (Exodus 21:12-14 - Deuteronomy 32:48-52 - 2 Kings 20:1-3 - Philippians 2:27-30) and 
sometimes to eternal life and eternal death (Proverbs 8:32-36 - 14:32 - John 1:4 - Isaiah 57:1-2 - 
Ezekiel 18:25-27 - 33:11 - 1 John 5:12-13).  
24 As a sixth example the word father in the scriptures does not necessarily refer to blood 
relationship (Genesis 45:8-9 - Exodus 4:22 - Judges 17:10 - 18:19 - 2 Kings 6:21 - 8:9 - 16:7 - 
Psalms 45:16-17 - Luke 20:41-44).  
25 And the father of the true children of Israel (Malachi 1:1-3 - Romans 9:6-8) is the holy spirit 
whose best representative is Jesus of Nazareth (4 Rommel 4:16 - John 8:19-20 - 12:42-46 - 14:8-9). 
Everyone is born ignorant and after the new birth our new father is the holy spirit who is the God of 
Israel (John 3:1-8 - 8:38-41,42-44 - 16:25-30).  
26 As a seventh example the word Law refers to two separate things. It may be the particular 
pedagogy of Moses (Galatians 3:23-26 - 1 Corinthians 9:20-21) within which the hereditary tribe of 
Levi and the hereditary successors of Aaron have a particular role (Numbers 18). And they are the 
only ones authorized to receive whatever any Jew may wish to offer to God.  
1626 
27 Or it may be the timeless law of Christ (1 Corinthians 9:21) since no one needs to be a Jew or 
know Moses before understanding the meaning of the word steal (appropriating the possession of 
another). 
28 As an eighth example there is a clear distinction between Passover and the Feast of Unleavened 
Bread (Leviticus 23:4-8) but the two are closely linked, so that over the centuries the name of one 
might have been used to designate the other (Ezekiel 45:21 - Luke 22:1,7-8 - John 13:1 - 19:14).  
29 In the sight of God the name of an entity is not some literal expression (Exodus 33:17 - Judges 
6:31-32 - 7:1-2) but the abstract concept that this entity represents (Exodus 34:14).  
30 For communities have different languages that can designate the same reality by different words 
and sounds, since the different alphabets sometimes have nothing in common.  
31 And when God speaks of destroying a people, it is not necessarily a question of removing all the 
celestial bodies of the individuals who constitute that people (Numbers 24:14-25 - Ephesians 6:12) 
but the idolatrous belief systems which are the foundations of the organization of social life in these 
communities (Numbers 14:21 - Isaiah 11:9-10 - Micah 5:1-4 - Habakkuk 2:13-14 - Jeremiah 16:19
21 - 30:10-11).  
32 The Epistle of John (4 Rommel 2:59-61) teaches somewhere that only one thing is required (1 
John 5:11-12,20-21), and elsewhere that it is actually two things (1 John 3:23) and perhaps more (1 
John 2:3-4).  
33 These nuances are necessary because obedience to the holy spirit implies on the one hand the 
confidence that this obedience will give a place to our heavenly body. And on the other hand, there 
is a methodology to follow (1 John 2:20 - 1 Kings 3:5-12 - Proverbs 1:1 - 10:1 - 25:1 - Ecclesiastes 
1:1 - 12:10-14). 
34 To reject any form of idolatry but submit to the rules established in the surrounding society 
(Proverbs 24:21-23). 
35 To obtain forgiveness for an offense by soliciting the actors concerned since this is the path 
indicated by the pedagogy of Moses (4 Rommel 7:19), and to practice justice and fairness when 
dealing with anyone even strangers (Proverbs 14:34 - 21:3-4).  
36 To understand that we are connected to our achievements by the notion of responsibility 
(Proverbs 6:1-5).  
37 To analyze each situation before reacting (Proverbs 12:16 - 14:29 - 15:1 - 16:32 - 20:3). 
38 To educate the youth because everyone comes into the world ignorant (Proverbs 3:11-12 - 13:24 - 22:6,15 - 23:12-21). 
39 To stay focused on the goal (Proverbs 4:20-27).  
40 There is no possibility of retaining the discriminatory pedagogy of Moses (Romans 2:13 - 
Galatians 3:10 - 2 Peter 3:15-16) because it is a sin against the holy spirit who is the true God 
(Isaiah 54).  
41 Just as the writings of the prophet Jeremiah take place before the Babylonian captivity and could 
therefore concern events to occur before the arrival of the messenger of the new covenant 
1627 
mentioned in chapter 31, these writings of the apostle Paul (Romans 2:13 - Galatians 3:10) occur 
while the temple of the Jews, the workplace of the tribe of Levi and of the high priest direct 
descendant of Aaron, is still in operation (John 11:49-52).  
42 Whoever wants to be under the law of Moses must absolutely identify all members of the 
hereditary tribe of Levi and the lawful successors among the sons of Aaron (Leviticus 25:32-34 - 
Numbers 5), and additionally identify all the Jews of mankind according to their paternal tribes 
(Leviticus 25:23-31 - Numbers 36 - Deuteronomy 23:19-20). 
43 Such a person is a real asshole and if he is not just an ignoramus who is content to do what his 
father or his mother or his neighbors or his brothers told him to do (2 Chronicles 21:1-5 - Judges 
9:1-5 - 1 Kings 12:10 - Job 32:1-10 - 2 Chronicles 15:16-17 - 22:8-12 - 2 Kings 6:26-29,30-31 - 
Isaiah 2:22) then he is truly cursed (Galatians 3:10).  
44 Finally we must make the connection between Romans 2:12 and Romans 3:20-22.  
45 And it is legitimate to ask what are the commandments considered by the apostle James who is 
supposed to be a disciple of Jesus of Nazareth and also a Jew at the same time (Luke 11:52 - 1 John 
2:18-21).  
46 For whoever keeps the whole law but sins against one commandment becomes guilty of all 
(James 2:10). Is anyone among you sick. Let him call the elders of the Church and let these elders 
pray for him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the 
sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him. 
Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. For 
the fervent prayer of a righteous man is very useful (James 5:14-16).  
47 Some point out that Acts 3:22-23 is not identical to Deuteronomy 18:18-19 and they thus 
indicate that Moses does not announce the arrival of a particular prophet who will give the people 
new or different laws (Deuteronomy 4:1-2) but that he announces a continuous series of prophets 
who will only give warnings to the people on future difficulties without ever changing a law that 
will never change (Genesis 1:29 - 9:1-3 - Leviticus 11:1-4).  
48 However Moses never asked God to build a house with doors and windows (Ezekiel 44:1-5 - 
46:1-3 - John 4:22) but only explained the plans for the construction of a movable work as the 
workplace of the high priest successor to Aaron, with the colors of the curtains and the 
arrangements of the altar of incense (Exodus 30:1-10) and of the altar of burnt offerings (Exodus 
27:1-8). 
49 And this teaching of Moses did not however survive forever but only during the nearly four 
hundred years which constitute the era judges (Judges 8:22-23 - Hosea 13:11 - Acts 7:44-53).  
50 Deuteronomy 30:11 could be paralleled with the fact that all the important characters in the 
scriptures, starting with Moses himself and king David as well, have offended God (Numbers 20:9
12 - 1 Kings 15:5). 
1628 
4 Rommel 12  
1 Theological vocabulary (Luke 1:31-33 - John 8:51), second part: Ultimate revelation. 
2 The only will of the creator of all things (God the Father) in the life of men is obedience to the 
holy spirit. And to transmit this teaching to men there were many prophets but the one who had the 
main and essential role was Jesus of Nazareth also called Son of God or Son of man (John 8:28 - 
Luke 13:18-21 - Acts 17:22-34).   
3 So we have God the Father, and God the Son, and God the holy spirit.  
4 The first chapter of the book of Genesis summarizes the story of creation and from the second 
chapter onwards it is about highlighting selected events for our instructions.  
5 Throughout the Hebrew Bible God blesses or curses different characters by promising them that 
particular events will occur sometimes during their lives in the flesh, but very often after the death 
of their bodies (Genesis 15:1-6 - 17:1-8 - Exodus 34:5-7 - Deuteronomy 25:17-19 - 1 Kings 21:27
29 - Jeremiah 22:24-30 - 2 Samuel 7:22-29 - Nehemiah 9:6-8). And each person receives particular 
promises according to his personal relationship with God, that is to say, according to his attachment 
to the spirit of justice which includes his obedience to the will of God of which he has knowledge 
(Exodus 32:33 - Deuteronomy 24:16 - Ecclesiastes 6:1-6 - 1 Kings 8:25 - 9:1-9).  
6 And Jesus of Nazareth came to explain to the Jews that he announces a good news to all mankind. 
It is that no one dies because each person is mathematically and physically connected to the totality 
of his or her accomplishments in the world. The kingdom of God is in our midst (Luke 17:20-21 - 
20:37-38 - 1 John 3:2-3 - Acts 25:19).  
7 His resurrection, a phenomenon already noted as being strange in the Jewish scriptures (Genesis 
5:21:24 - 2 Kings 2:1-18 - 13:20-21), demonstrates the existence of eternal life (Acts 1:1-11) and 
makes us understand the means to access it (1 Peter 1:18-22 - John 3:16).  
8 Just imitate his behavior by clinging to the holy spirit in all circumstances (John 13:34-35).  
9 His words were spoken and written to comfort and sustain us in the midst of different trials. And 
if I obey his teaching, then I become the new form of his body and he becomes my spirit (Romans 
8:9) because I have included him in the effective chain of transmission of information that I use to 
carry out my own realizations (John 14:22-24).  
10 All the creators of sects and cults (2 Peter 2:15-19 - John 8:32) want to use you to give a place to 
their own heavenly body and to achieve this goal they must be directly responsible for a knowledge 
that you proudly use regularly in your life.  
11 Either there are very small things to perform such as praying in a special way at particular times 
in addition to other prayers that may come from your own initiative, or practicing fasts on certain 
days of the week that have been chosen for you. Or they insist on certain vocabularies to be used 
systematically when the circumstances are favorable, or on the supposed exact spelling of certain 
expressions. Or they impose to have a significant utility in some of the most important events in 
your life, such as contributing to the choice of your life partner and ensuring that this relationship in 
which they have a great deal of responsibility produces lasting fruits (eg children).  
1629 
12 The only way to endure eternal life without going to hell (leaving others a disgusting memory as 
a legacy) is to consistently practice what feels right and just to you in all your interactions with 
others, according to the information available to you. There are no other secrets, there is no 
particular ritual to practice.  
13 The spirit of God is the spirit of justice and equity and this spirit can dwell in anyone who wishes 
but be careful, not everyone wants this and some know how to hide their intentions very well.  
14 At any given moment there are only two kinds of people in the world namely those who are only 
concerned with the flourishing of all mankind and those who do not care (Luke 9:50 - 11:23).  
15 Those who act out of ignorance still have the possibility of conversion (John 6:37) because every 
normal human being must offend the holy spirit (Psalms 32). But whoever renounces the faith after 
having had an exact knowledge of it, the same one is definitely cursed (Luke 12:10).   
16 False Jews, whether they are spiritual or fleshly descendants of converted peoples (Esther 8:15
17) or whether they are truly of Abraham, know that not all the prophets of scripture are of the tribe 
of Levi. King David of Judah spoke from God (Psalms 22), and the son of a prostitute woman was a 
judge in Israel (Judges 11:1-3).  
17 But they refuse to understand that the spirit of God cannot remain locked within four walls in a 
very holy place which only a privileged few have the right to approach according to their genealogy 
and function within that genealogy (Exodus 29:29-30 - 30:1-10 - Numbers 8:22-26).  
18 A holy place that was initially in a moving structure (Exodus 26:30-37 - 40:1-7 - Numbers 1:47
54) which actually moved from place to place (Joshua 18:1 - 24:25-27 - Judges 20:25-28 - 1 Samuel 
1:1-3 - 21:1,6 - 1 Chronicles 21:29). It is not abnormal that during a part of the time when there was 
still no king in Israel to represent the people before God, the tent of meeting was often moved since 
all tribes were expected to be equal in the eyes of God. But from a certain time it was installed at 
Shiloh (Judges 18:31 - 21:19) in a structure called the temple of Yahweh because Samuel, whose 
father is not of the tribe of Levi, has his dwelling within (1 Samuel 1:1-2 - 3:1-3,15 - Jeremiah 7:9
15).  
19 A holy place that king David wanted to immobilize (2 Samuel 6:15-17 - 7:1-2 - 1 Chronicles 
22:17-19) and that the prophet Ezekiel proposes to immortalize (Ezekiel 43:10-12 - 48:29-35).  
20 They refuse to understand that there is no particular time of day or particular days of the year to 
fully experience God's presence (2 Kings 4:22-23).  
21 Jacob also prophesied that his own spirit would not naturally be united with that of the Levites 
(Genesis 49:5-7).  
22 Indeed, what could be more petty than a Jew who considers himself to be the intermediary 
between God and men (1 Thessalonians 2:13-16).  
23 What is stronger than the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, and what is sweeter than 
Jesus of Nazareth (Judges 14:14 - 1 Corinthians 15:3-4).  
24 It is not a man who builds a house for God (Exodus 20:22-23 - Psalms 50 - 132:1-9 - Isaiah 
66:1-2 - 2 Samuel 7:4-7 - 1 Chronicles 17:3-6).  
1630 
25 It is God who builds a house for those he loves [that is to say, he allows them to have a legacy 
that endures forever (4 Rommel 11:23 - 12:60)] in order to reward them for their devotion to the 
holy spirit (Genesis 6:5-13 - 2 Samuel 7:11,16 - 1 Chronicles 17:10,14 - Psalms 132:10-18). And 
Jesus of Nazareth had the best place in the hearts of living beings because he has clung to the holy 
spirit since his birth and has never turned away from it (John 8:45-52 - 4 Rommel 14:12). And God 
will always succeed in giving a place to every person who loves the holy spirit (# The legacy of 
John the Baptist had some influence in the transformation that the world underwent - Luke 3:15-16 - John 14:1-2 - 1 Peter 3:21-22  - 4 Rommel 6:43 # And those who chose to cling to the Jewish 
people in the days before the coming of Christ were binding their souls to the usefulness that Jewish 
people have had in clarifying the identity of God - 4 Rommel 7:10 # And what is eternal is the holy 
spirit - 4 Rommel 4:10 - 1 Peter 1:24-25), because nothing is impossible for God (Genesis 18:9
12,13-14 - Jeremiah 32:16-18,24-27).  
26 And it is impossible to surprise God (John 3:27 - Isaiah 29:15-16) because everyone always acts 
according to one's own nature. What changes is the information available and understood and the 
accumulated experience.  
27 When we come into the world, we do not know how to behave in order to archive our own goal 
without this being followed by any unpleasant surprise through cause and effect relationships. [For 
each person is free to set his own goals (John 1:35-39 - 16:23-24 - Proverbs 24:17-18 - 2 
Thessalonians 3:1-5,6-16 - 2 Peter 2:9-19 - 4 Rommel 12:24-25). Ezra returned to Jerusalem in the 
seventh year of king Artaxerxes (Ezra 7:1-7,8-10), but the will to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem is an 
initiative of Nehemiah who returned to the promised land in the twentieth year of king Artaxerxes 
(Nehemiah 1:1-11 - 2:1-20 - 8:1-6 - 13:1-6). And even among the apostles of Christ who are filled 
with the Holy Spirit, each one can have his own opinion concerning the solution that is suitable in a 
particular context to achieve the only objective which is the glorification of the God of Israel (Acts 
9:17-20 - 11:19-22,23-26 - 13:1-4 - 15:35-41 - Romans 14:1-5,6-13 - John 3:8).]  
28 Perhaps we must trust people who are rich, or old people, or very strong people, or our parents 
regardless of our age (2 Chronicles 21:1-5 - Judges 9:1-5 - 1 Kings 12:10 - Job 32:1-10 - 2 
Chronicles 15:16-17 - 22:8-12 - 2 Kings 6:26-29,30-31 - Isaiah 2:22). 
29 Maybe we have to lie to everyone when there is no constraint and simply to protect our privacy 
or for fun (Zechariah 8:16-17 - 1 Samuel 25:14-38 - 2 Samuel 13:10-20 - 2 Kings 5:15-27 - John 
3:20-21 - Isaiah 5:8-16).  
30 Maybe we have to make human sacrifices (Jeremiah 7:31 - 32:35 - Judges 11:30-40 - 
Deuteronomy 23:21-23 - Leviticus 27:28-29 - Ezekiel 20:25-26,30-31), or call on the dead to ask 
them what our behavior should be among those who are alive (1 Samuel 28:11-15), or carefully 
observe the brightness of the night and the configuration of the most visible stars (2 Kings 21:6) in 
order to achieve our own goals with a lasting satisfaction (Jeremiah 9:23-24 - Habakkuk 2 - Isaiah 
5:21-24).  
31 There is only one solution which is completely revealed by Jesus of Nazareth (2 Chronicles 9:7
8 - 1 Peter 1:18-25 - John 3:16 - Colossians 1:21-23).   
1631 
32 And if the witnesses of his life and his resurrection were few it is not because God is wicked but 
because those who were chosen had the privilege of continuing to exist eternally by the information 
they transmitted to us.  
33 It should not be an absurdity to define a celestial body as being the extension of a physical body 
by the notion of responsibility. A child still in the womb of the mother can provoke at a moment 
given, while she is imagining the future, a particular smile that will be seen, through a television 
that has been offered to him, by someone who will feel inspired and who will therefore take such an 
initiative and so on and the world is exchange.  
34 The ten commandments cannot be for all mankind, God having given possessions to other 
human communities without giving them the ten words (Deuteronomy 2:1-12 - 5:1-4).  
35 The sabbath day was created for the explanations of Jesus of Nazareth on the true identity of 
God according to the apostle Paul (Colossians 2:16-23) and on this day we did not stop caring about 
the prosperity of others but we taught the knowledge of a God whose identity was not yet fully 
revealed (Luke 4:16-21 - 14:1-6 - John 7:22-29).  
36 What Jesus of Nazareth says is that on the one hand it is not the sabbath day that gives eternal 
life and the purpose of life is to obtain eternal life (1 Corinthians 15:45 - 1 John 1:2 - John 1:4). And 
on the other hand, if it is not a bad thing for a community not to systematically carry out the tasks 
essential to its survival every day of the week, it should not be thought that there must be a 
particular day of the week when we must stop worrying about the development of our neighbor.  
37 Moreover, if the tablets of stones teach that covetousness is an offense against the creator of all 
things, pride is not mentioned (Daniel 4:30-37 - Colossians 3:23-25 - Ephesians 2:20-22 - 2 
Timothy 3:16-17). 
38 Jesus did not say: Carry a cross, walk a path with it and be crucified once a year or once in your 
life.  
39 Condition A and condition B and condition C, is different from condition A only (Leviticus 11:1
7). Also compare Luke 9:23 - 14:27 with Luke 8:10-11 - 14:34-35 - John 16:25,29.  
40 But he said: Love one another as I have loved you (John 15:12,17).  
41 If christianity consists in being a disciple of Jesus of Nazareth, the works to be accomplished by 
a disciple depending on the interpretations of the different movements and schools of thought, and 
that in addition this Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew whose teaching is based solely on the Jewish 
religion, then how can we deny that christianity originated from a very ancient Jewish people 
(Romans 10:17 - John 4:22).  
42 But all of this does not mean that christianity should continue to regard Judaism as an acceptable 
religion because of its origins.  
43 This would be to misunderstand the teachings because what is said is that everything was 
savagery on earth, even Judaism which was simply one of the less savage organizations but which 
was also a savagery among others (Ezekiel 46:1-3 - Galatians 3:22 - Job 35:5-8).  
1632 
44 And then a long-foretold light came into the world (Luke 13:18-21 - John 8:12). And he who 
does not receive this light is an outcast (Luke 9:50 - 11:23).  
45 Judaism is indeed a religion which is centered on two hereditary things transmitted only at birth, 
namely belonging to the tribe of Levi and being a legitimate successor of Aaron.  
46 And after the message of Jesus Christ some authors, among whom were Matthew and Mark who 
designed their books to make christianity unbearable for anyone interested in the foundation which 
is the Hebrew Bible, and also James, wanted to save something (Deuteronomy 23:1-8 - Numbers 
5:11-31 - 36:5-13) that must disappear (Hosea 6:6 - 14:1-2 - Isaiah 66:3).  
47 For the true holy of holies (Exodus 26:33-34) is in the heart and everyone is a Jew in the eyes of 
God (Exodus 20:22-23 - Joel 2:28-32 - Romans 2:28-29).  
48 The spirit of prophecy (Ezekiel 1:1-3), which distributes different gifts to different people (1 
Corinthians 12:4-12), is the testimony of Jesus-Christ (John 3:17-21) and even the falsifications 
know it as in the following extract. 
49 And the angel said to me, Write this, Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of 
the Lamb. And the angel said to me, These are true words of God. And I fell at his feet to worship 
him, but he said to me: Be careful not to do it. I am your companion in service, and that of your 
brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of 
prophecy (Revelation 19:9-10).   
50 In the early days of Christianity, a follower of Christ who was not a Jew did not necessarily have 
to behave like a follower of Christ who was a Jew.  
51 For the latter could continue to give the hereditary tribe of Levi their means of sustenance while 
Paul tells the non-Jew that the true temple God is not this man-made house that is still standing but 
rather the body of Christ who is still alive (Acts 5:12-29,30-42 - 25:19). [In those days it was not 
easy to convince the Jews that the message of Jesus came from the God of Moses, and that is why 
the apostles prayed for the strength to perform miracles (Acts 6:1-7 - 8:5-8 - 9:31-35,36-42 - 13:1
12). For they had to convince the Jews that if a person commits a sin by offending another person 
then the forgiveness of such a sin can be done without the intermediary of a priest who is a 
descendant of Aaron (John 20:21-23 - Acts 4:32-37). They had to convince them that the temple of 
God, which has not yet been destroyed, must simply become a privileged place for teaching the 
message of Jesus (Acts 5:12-20,21-29). And the only thing that Jesus asked is to love one's neighbor 
as oneself, in other words one must do nothing in a publicly unjustifiable way and one must seek 
the good of others in everything that is done. For the teaching of Jesus is that there is eternal life 
that is accessible only through faith in his holy commandment, but even the apostles of Jesus do not 
know the exact definition of eternal life despite the fact that they know the only way to access it. 
That is why the disciples of Jesus do not intend to destroy the temple built to serve God through the 
commands given by Moses, but rather to explain the message of Jesus to all the Jews and gradually 
convince them (Acts 16:1-3 - 21:17-25,26-30 - 25:1-8,9-11 - 28:16-20,21-29 - Luke 5:36-39). And 
the temple will be destroyed by the Romans because of a revolt of the part of the Jews who have 
refused to believe in Jesus Christ and to teach his message to their children, and this is similar to the 
fact that the first Jewish temple built by Solomon had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar king of 
Babylon after a revolt of Zedekiah the last king of Judah.] 
1633 
52 The apostle Paul teaches in a context that is not eternal and he indicated in twelve letters, out of 
the thirteen attributed to him and which bear his name in the introductions of the texts, that he is in 
charge of edifying non-Jews.  
53 Moreover, the spirit of Jesus of Nazareth was very dense in the early days of christianity because 
there was not yet much intermediary between the author of the message and the receiver.  
54 Today when I recite a biblical verse which is supposed to be his word, it is not only his spirit that 
is invoked but rather the whole chain of responsibility which allowed this knowledge to be available 
to me in a specific place and at a precise moment since the message of Jesus Christ is that no one 
dies and that the kingdom of God is among us.  
55 And these responsibilities are of various natures since there are theologians but also the printing 
press which published this book which I hold in hand or the manufacturer of this computer on 
which I am reading.  
56 But all this is not a problem because there has never been any difference between men 
(Deuteronomy 10:16-20 - 1 John 4:20-21) and the true eternal God is the holy spirit (Ecclesiastes 
7:10-14).  
57 The special child who must forever strengthen the throne of king David (Isaiah 9:5-7) is Jesus of 
Nazareth whose body is the true temple of God (John 2:18-21) because when we practice his 
teachings we become his body (Ephesians 1:22-23) and his spirit which is also the spirit of God 
(John 3:34) then dwells in us (Ephesians 2:17-22 - 1 Corinthians 6:15-20).  
58 Jesus of Nazareth is the only absolutely perfect man in the eyes of God. Without this certainty 
one would have considered possible the theories that lend him a different bride from the church 
(John 3:29-34) while John the Baptist would have lived in the wilderness and then had his head cut 
off (Luke 1:76-80 - 3:1-6 - 9:9) or even the theories that attribute to him children according to the 
flesh so as to attenuate the perfect beauty of his celestial body (1 Corinthians 7:7-8 - Isaiah 54:1-5).   
59 The God of Israel is triune because the creative Father is intimately united with two main angels 
who are the Son and the holy spirit (Zechariah 4:3,11-14). Furthermore, the creator probably has 
seven main angels (Zechariah 4:2,10).  
60 God can use the most unexpected means to enable those He loves to have, possibly anonymous, 
an eternally useful inheritance that can continue to exist in an enhanced form (Isaiah 40:25-28 - 
Jeremiah 45 - Proverbs 16:7 - Exodus 13:17-18).  
61 It is not a sin to be strong or rich. But it is a sin to consider that these trumps can scare the lord 
of all the earth or that these trumps are a marvelous gift from him because it is not these things that 
can pass with certainty to future generations an eternally wonderful inheritance (Proverbs 18:11 - 
Psalms 49 - Habakkuk 1:6-12 - Zechariah 4:6).   
62 God is for equal opportunities everywhere and at all times, considering everyone only according 
to their real abilities without favoring the poor (Exodus 23:1-8) and without disfavoring the rich 
(Exodus 30:14-15).  
63 This does not mean that within any community any foreigner making a temporary stay must 
have exactly the same rights as a native in all aspects of social life.  
1634 
64 However if you have to evaluate different people on a particular parameter (students in a 
classroom may be of different nationalities and backgrounds, some not even having confirmed legal 
status yet and I am in charge of assessing their knowledge of history - there was a fight in the street 
because a person provoked another and I am responsible for identifying the culprit - a person is 
looking for an object that was stolen from him and I am in charge to understand and solve his 
problem).  
65 Then only the parameter concerned must be the object of the concern of the judge who must not 
worry about the other aspects of the life of the people involved (2 Chronicles 19:1-11 
Deuteronomy 1:16-17).  
66 Some atheist does not seek proof of the existence of any god because logic is sufficient to 
understand nature but in this statement no clear definition of the word 'god' is proposed: if I say that 
I believe in the God of logic, am I in contradiction with the atheist.  
67 False christians give the wrong meaning to the phrase 'believe in Jesus of Nazareth' because 
christianity teaches that Jesus is the king of the Jews (Luke 23:38 - John 19:19-22) therefore a 
christian must ask himself: What should a Jew who loves the King of the Jews do.  
68 The commandments of the Jewish Bible are not frozen in time because between the beginning of 
Genesis and the Levitical book of Moses there is an evolution of what is allowed to eat (Genesis 
1:29 - 9:1-3 - Leviticus 11:1-4).  
69 And the events described in the last five chapters of the book of Judges occurred after the death 
of Joshua (Judges 17:6 - 18:1 - 19:1), and the populations have their habits (Exodus 20:3-4 - 
Deuteronomy 5:7-8 - Exodus 28:30 - Leviticus 8:5-8 - Deuteronomy 33:8-11 - Numbers 27:18-21 - 
Judges 17). But it is inconceivable that the tribe of Dan did not offer peace to their enemies 
[designated by Moses and Joshua] before attacking them (Judges 18:27-30 - Deuteronomy 20:10-12 - Joshua 11:18-20 - 1 Chronicles 4:38-43), for it must be thought that this was simply not 
mentioned.  
70 And also the commandments of Moses are not all kept even by those who really love God since 
the tabernacle, the dwelling place of Yahweh which was built by Moses, has been replaced through 
the initiative of king David by a stationary house (2 Samuel 7:1-3). And it is possible that it was not 
only the members of the tribe of Levi who taught the knowledge of the law of Moses to the people 
in the time of Jesus of Nazareth (Numbers 3:11-16,39-41,42-51 - Deuteronomy 10:5-9 - Nehemiah 
8:6-12), since Jesus was from the tribe of Judah and he was not condemned because he taught in the 
synagogues of the people (Luke 4:14-16 - 7:1-5 - John 6:57-60 - 18:19-20) and in the temple of 
Yahweh (Luke 2:40-46 - 19:45-48 - 21:37-38 - John 8:19-20 - 10:22-24 - Deuteronomy 12:13-14) 
but only because of his particular message (Luke 4:20-28,29-30 - John 5:16-18 - 10:25-36). [Since 
the functions that had been assigned to the Levites in the past (Numbers 1:50-54 - 4:1-20,21-28,29
33) should no longer be valid even in theory after the movable tabernacle built by Moses will has 
been replaced by a fixed house, therefore David gave new functions to the Levites (1 Chronicles 
16:1-7 - 23:27-32 - 2 Chronicles 29:25) and for this reason David asked to number the Levites who 
will carry out the service by designating them among those who are twenty years old and above (1 
Chronicles 23:1-3,25-27). For during the days of Moses, when the Levites had just received the 
function of transporting the sanctuary of Yahweh, the plans of which were shown to Moses because 
1635 
this structure did not exist before (5 Rommel 9:14-17 - Exodus 25:9,40 - 26:30 - 39:42-43), the 
Levites were numbered from the age of one month to know their total (Numbers 3:14-16,39 - 
26:57-62,63-65) or from the age of thirty to transport the tabernacle (Numbers 4:34-49), and they 
could serve in the different parts of the sanctuary from the age of twenty five (Numbers 8:22-26).]   
71 Whoever calls himself a religious Jew practicing Judaism after having read the writings on Jesus 
is really someone strange because he has deep down himself, in everything he does, the secret 
mission of identifying the twelve tribes of Israel distinctly.  
72 And if he is asked why he believes in the Hebrew Bible which he himself received without 
having witnessed its writing, and does not believe in Jesus of Nazareth who is also an available 
knowledge.  
73 Then on the one hand he can explain that there are inconsistencies in the christian New 
Testament.  
74 However there are also in the Hebrew Bible, and in the same way that there are also books which 
are not considered as being holy scriptures by the Jewish bible, in the same way he should be 
interested in separating the books of the new testament author by author in order to also identify 
possible falsifications.  
75 The apostle Paul teaches that God loves everyone from same way but that it is aimed primarily at 
non-Jews to teach them the knowledge of the faith.  
76 On the other hand he can ask us why we believe in Jesus without having witnessed these events 
ourselves, but we only know that there is a message worthy of being received and whoever does not 
accept this message is an enemy of humanity (Galatians 3:21-29 - 1 John 4:20-21). 
77 A religious artistic presentation does not necessarily consist in alluding to the holy scripture 
because it is simply a question of exposing useful achievements for its development, likely to be 
imitated in an edifying way. 
78 In other words it is a question of bearing witness to the power of the holy spirit (Zechariah 4:6). 
Thus the trick of the Devil consists in promoting behaviors that are either useless or destructive. 
4 Rommel 13  
1 Moses (Numbers 28–29) vs Ezekiel (Ezekiel 45–46) concerning the obligatory part of burnt 
offerings, and burnt offerings are not eaten (4 Rommel 7:13). And these are the only offerings for 
which there are fixed dates in advance. [The only other offerings that are obligatory according to 
the law of Moses and that Ezekiel did not mention are the offering that must be made on the day of 
reconciliation (1 Rommel 3:35), and on the occasion of the celebration of the harvests at the feast of 
Firstfruits (Leviticus 23:9-22).]  
2 Regarding the perpetual holocaust, on the one hand the meal offering is a tenth of an ephah of fine 
flour kneaded in a quarter of a hin of crushed olive oil every morning and every evening (Numbers 
28:1-8).  
1636 
3 And on the other hand the meal offering is one-sixth of an ephah and one-third of a hin of oil 
every morning Ezekiel (46:13-15).  
4 Each sabbath day, on the one hand, two yearling lambs are to be offered with a meal offering of 
two-tenths of an ephah (Numbers 28:9-10). 
5 And on the other hand, six lambs and a ram are to be offered with a ephah for the ram and a 
voluntary gift for each lamb (Ezekiel 46:4-5). 
6 At the beginning of each month which is the new moon, on the one hand it takes two bullocks and 
a ram and seven lambs (Numbers 28:11-15). 
7 And on the other hand it takes a bullock and a ram and six lambs (Ezekiel 46:6-7,11). 
8 During each of the seven consecutive days of the feast which follows the fourteenth day of the 
first month, on the one hand there must be two bullocks and a ram and seven lambs (Numbers 
28:16-25). 
9 And on the other hand there must be seven bullocks and seven rams (Ezekiel 45:21-24).  
10 And during each of the seven consecutive days of the feast which begins on the fifteenth day of 
the seventh month, the sacrifices must be identical for each each day according to Ezekiel (Ezekiel 
45:21-24,25). 
11 While there is from day by day a constant reduction of the number of bullocks to be offered 
according to Moses (Numbers 29:12-40).  
12 We also notice a difference on the associated meal offerings (Numbers 29:14-15 - Ezekiel 
46:11). 
13 On the one hand, Moses had specified the ceremony that must be performed for the consecration 
of Aaron, and also each time for the consecration of the one among his sons who is chosen to 
succeed him as high priest (Exodus 29:1-14,29-34,35-37). And when Moses had set up the 
sanctuary of Yahweh for the first time after its construction, twelve leaders had approached to make 
an offering for the dedication of the sanctuary. There was one leader from each of the twelve tribes 
who are not supposed to serve in the sanctuary, since Levi is not included and Joseph is divided into 
two tribes. And those leaders had made a common offering which was to have some use for the sons 
of Levi whom Yahweh had chosen to be at his service in the sanctuary and to move this sanctuary 
each time when the congregation had to be moved (Numbers 7:1-9), and those leaders had also 
presented offerings for the inauguration of the altar of sacrifices (Numbers 7:10-11,84-88), but these 
offerings were made voluntarily and not according to a law imposed by Yahweh since different 
offerings were made for the dedication of the temple built by Solomon (1 Kings 8:62-63 - 2 
Chronicles 7:1-5) and for the dedication of the temple that had just been rebuilt after the return of 
the captives from Babylon (Ezra 6:15-18). We notice that Yahweh loves very much the deeds that 
are done voluntarily by the initiative of the heart and not because of an external constraint 
(Leviticus 7:11-16,17-18 - 19:5-6 - 22:29-30 - Ezekiel 43:4 - 46:12 - Malachi 1:14 - 2 Chronicles 
30:21-27), but he who does such a deed must be careful not to transgress the law of which he is 
aware (2 Rommel 5 - Romans 2:28-29).  
1637 
14 On the other hand, in the temple of Ezekiel the priests will be only the sons of Zadok who is 
himself a descendant of Aaron (Ezekiel 44:10-14,15-16), and Ezekiel says nothing about the 
consecration of the sons of Zadok but he describes the ritual that must be performed only once 
during seven days for the inauguration of the altar of sacrifices (Ezekiel 43:18-21,22-27). 
4 Rommel 14  
1 Conclusion.  
2 When we come into the world we find different narratives on various subjects and they all have a 
historical character so that a classification in order of usefulness can only be made after examining 
and understanding the teachings offered.  
3 The notion of eternal life is clearly stated (4 Rommel 1:1-12 - 8:13-14) and what belongs to the 
realm of belief is the methodology to follow in order to endure in this mathematical space that is 
inseparable from the perceptible universe (4 Rommel 1:25 - 2:26 - 4:3-4 - John 8:45-52). 
4 Perhaps some rituals should be practiced at special times (John 14:3-6). The solution given by 
Jesus of Nazareth is the following thing: No one does anything without having a certain motivation 
inside himself, and what the creator of all things demands of each person is to have at every 
moment a justification that is PUBLICLY acceptable in his own eyes, even if he is the only one to 
know a part of the information that determines his behavior (Isaiah 51:12-13). In other words, his 
intentions must be continuously PUBLICLY justifiable in his own eyes (5 Rommel 4:1-7 - 5:44
45,46-47 - 4 Rommel 12:27 - 3 Rommel 1:49 - John 4:39-44 - Exodus 22:18 - Jeremiah 16:19-21 - 
Ecclesiastes 7:28-29). [Now the bible explains how this information that I have clarified, which is 
the definition of the Holy Spirit, was created in the world by Jesus of Nazareth (2 Corinthians 4:1
5). For every living being who comes into the world creates a particular information. And Jesus 
makes us understand that the ten commandments were given for the sole purpose of explaining how 
not to comply with them since what is interesting is why a person does something and not what that 
person does, and one of these ten commandments had the sole purpose of allowing a particular 
person called Christ to come into the world to create his particular legacy which consists in 
demonstrating the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 6:6-11 - Acts 3:17-21 - Psalms 110:1 - 2 
Corinthians 5:19-21 - 6:1-13). And the ten commandments were declared to all the people who 
came out of Egypt (Exodus 12:37-38 - 20:18-23) for the sole purpose of perpetuating the personal 
legacies of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob (Genesis 18:18-19 - 49:10 - Malachi 1:1-3 - 4 
Rommel 12:24-25), and the coming of the revelation of Christ was delayed by the great 
transgression of the people who had just come out of Egypt (1 Rommel 1:37 - 3:20 - 3 Rommel 
1:47-49 - 4 Rommel 1:24).] 
5 There has always been a subtle difference between obedience to God and strict observance of the 
commandments of Moses' pedagogical law (John 5:39-40,41-47 - 2 Kings 18:1-7 - 23:24-27 - 2 
Chronicles 32:32-33 - 35:20-27). [During these days when the exact identity of God is still 
unknown, Hezekiah was attached to the spirit (2 Chronicles 30:1-21,22-27) and Josiah was attached 
to the law (2 Chronicles 35:1-19)]

6 And since at the moment of the application of any commandment each one is alone before his 
God (Leviticus 7:11-18 - 19:5-6 - 22:29-30 - Amos 4:1-5 - Leviticus 10:1-7,16-20 - Numbers 10:29
33 - 32:1-5,16-23 - 2 Corinthians 3:12-18 - 1 Samuel 4:1-22 - 7:1-17 - 1 Chronicles 21:28-30 - 
Joshua 22 - Colossians 1:24-29 - John 5:39-40 - Luke 7:23-30,31-35).  
7 Therefore this document proposes blind confidence in a hypothesis recognized as timeless by an 
original analysis of part of the biblical texts (Acts 13:38-52). 
8 Namely the Hebrew Bible, and the Gospels of John and Luke, and the Acts of the Apostles, and 
the letters of Paul(13), and the letters of Peter(2), and the letter of John(1).  
9 According to this theory which recalls natural selection in biology, populations as a whole tend to 
reproduce only, among the knowledge acquired in experimental situations, those that seem useful 
for the collective well-being. 
10 As a result of this presentation, we must ask ourselves about the meaning of agnosticism and 
atheism by wondering if it is for the member to impose on oneself moral principles that one refuses 
by ignorance to designate by the word God (Daniel 3 and Daniel 4 and Daniel 6). 
11 Or if it is a question of denying the existence of heavenly bodies, conceived as an extension of 
physical bodies by the notions of responsibility and intellectual property (2 Rommel 8 - 4 Rommel 
12:33), by defending the freedom to flourish without ever worrying about a possible justification of 
our actions to the circumstantially identifiable interlocutors (1 Rommel 1:38). 
12 The observable physical death of the body is theologically attributed to the notion of sin which is 
individual without this excluding more precise causes studied by science. [For Jesus was born with 
the holy spirit since he did not commit any sin in his entire life, and consequently he was 
resurrected (1 Corinthians 15:12-22 - 2 Corinthians 5:19-21 - 1 Peter 2:21-22 - 1 John 3:3-7). And if 
John the Baptist who lived with the holy spirit died according to the flesh (Luke 1:12-15 - 7:24-30 - 
9:7-9), it is because he was the reincarnation of Elijah (Malachi 4:4-6 - Luke 1:16-17 - 4 Rommel 
2:63-64). For Elijah had not lived without sin like any other ordinary man, and Elijah had not yet 
died according to the flesh (2 Kings 2:11 - John 1:6-8). And John the Baptist seems not to know it 
himself since he recognizes himself only as the messenger who was announced by the prophet 
Isaiah (John 1:19-36 - Isaiah 40:1-5).]  
13 And the question of the existence of a goal in life seems to be reduced to that to know if the one 
who has not simply wandered off at a certain stage of one’s life like king Solomon and who never 
cares about the interest of the rest of humanity as a whole can also transmit to future generations a 
heritage continuously used with admiration.
