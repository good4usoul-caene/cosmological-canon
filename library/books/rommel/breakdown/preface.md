The Most Holy Bible  
The Hebrew Bible and The Testament of Jesus Christ  
and My Biblical Commentary  
by Rommel Nana Dutchou  

Holiness to Yahweh: This work is fully offered to the public domain, and I guarantee to the reader  
that the necessary clarifications have been made so that no ambiguity remains in anything useful.  
It is a question of restoring what seems to me to be the exact meaning of the thought of the early  
authors of the biblical books, and the clarifications that could not be made in the rewriting of the  
verses have been grouped together in the letters of my associated commentary. All the complexity  
of the jewish law given by Moses has been stripped bare.

**Preface**  

This work is presented as a restoration of meaning rather than a new invention.  
The Hebrew Bible is laid out with its historical, literary, and wisdom books,  
followed by the major and minor prophets.  

The Testament of Jesus Christ is arranged beginning with the Gospel accounts,  
the Acts of the Apostles, and the Epistles, continuing through the letters of Paul,  
Peter, and John.  

My Biblical Commentary accompanies these texts, offering clarifications where  
the original verses could not be rewritten without loss of fidelity.  
The intent is to strip away ambiguity and restore clarity to the thought of the  
early authors.  

The reader is invited to approach these texts with reverence,  
but also with the assurance that the commentary seeks to illuminate rather than  
obscure.
