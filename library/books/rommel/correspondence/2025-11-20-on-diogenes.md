Diogenes was a philosopher who tended to perform acts that were generally considered obscene.  He was once asked by Alexander the Great if he needed any boon, and Diogenes answere, yes, get out of my sunlight.  Diogenes was known to carry a lantern in broad daylight, and cry out for just "One Honest Man".  

It was with Diogenes Spirit that I corresponded with Rommel, in this paragraph below. 

**Agree and Disagree.  The Spirit of Truth is distinct from the Holy Spirit.  He does not speak what is Holy, but what is True.  At best, the Spirit of Truth editorializes itself to not go on and on about orgasm, defecation, urination, circumcision with oral suctioning, and all of the carnal stuff generally not associated with holiness, but still part of God's ultimate design (if not the Patriarchs' design).  While I aspire to discretion, regarding these things, there are situations where a Spirit of Truth is incompatible with discretion.  Discretion can be a form of vanity.  The comforter's role is to advocate for Job (the first beast of revelations), advocate for Ezekiel (the second beast of revelations), and advocate for John (Maher Shalal Hash Baz), to correct the record on what they actually mean, and to guide humanity into wisdom with regards to those parts of themselves of which they are ashamed of.  Because shame is not a good teacher into the ways to behave righteously.**

Currently I am considering a revision of the paragraph, as many of the claims I'm making here may be deeply shocking to the uninitiated, both secular and religious.
