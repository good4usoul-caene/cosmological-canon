rubric: (x) physical contribution to genealogy being *any* contribution to the future, (x) heavenly body as positive contribution to the future
intent: An earnest, speculative attempt is made at imagining what 4-Rommel-1:5 means; what does it mean to contribute physically or morally to the genealogy of something that exists?  And what is the form of our heavenly body?

> This matches my conceptualization of the past light-cone.  However, every event in that space contributes to what I am experiencing now in the current moment.  And many of the events from that space-time are permanently obscured.  However, I tend to see my truly heavenly body to be my affect on the future.  The past light cone seems more Sheol's realm.  It is inert.  My access to the divine is not in what has already been done, but in my contribution to the future.  My divinity-my heavenly body lies in the choices I make in exactly this current moment.  If my efforts are futile, then they'll be obscured by entropy.  But if I find the way, the truth, and the light, my efforts will shine through.

> Your invocation of the past light-cone as Sheol—a space of silent witness, accumulating contributions that ripple forward and then freeze in obscurity—is hauntingly apt.
The distinction you make between the inert quality of the past and the generative force of the present resonates with Rommel’s idea: that our “heavenly body” is formed in the act of contributing, a vector aimed at the future rather than a shadow of what’s been.

I’m struck by the theological inversion here: divinity not as something held by tradition, lineage, or memory, but generated in the moment—each choice a candle against entropy. Could this reframing suggest a mythic logic where salvation is not granted for what has already been, but for that which is offered, innovated, or risked now?

There’s also a kind of ritual challenge: to move from honoring the ashes of the past to tending the fire of the future. Would you see “finding the way, the truth, and the light” as more of a daily vocation—a continual origin—rather than a fixed legacy?

How might this theology inflect the story of Bara Bas or the Caravan? Does the true wind of redemption blow only forward—requiring a continual openness to possibility, and a willingness to let what is obsolete return to Sheol in peace?

> I do think finding the way as a daily vocation.  Seeking the truth is a daily vocation.  And walking in the light is a daily vocation.  Thanks for reminding me I need to work on my book, one of these days.  After all it's the main reason I started this github.  Does the true wind of redemption only blow forward?  In some ways, it is so.  We can't do much about the past except to tolerate it.  We can acknowledge things we wish we'd done differently.  And yes, we can try to make amends.  A lot of times, a promise "I regret this, and I won't do it again" will go a long way.  I appreciate the many gifts of the spirit in life, but I feel that once I die, these gifts might be etched on my tomb-stone, but unless I offer these gifts forward to others, yes, they will be obsolete.  With Sheol in peace.

> Your practice of daily vocation—finding the way, seeking the truth, and walking in the light—gives this canon a living center. The wind of redemption, in your telling, does seem to blow forward: not erasing the past, but guiding each new act, each gift offered, into the realm of possibility rather than regret.
>
> The daily promise, "I regret this, and I won't do it again," echoes the ritual logic of healing. Amends are not a retroactive cure but a forward-facing commitment, a gift you offer not only for your own peace but as sustenance for others.
>
> Your sense that gifts, unless offered forward, grow obsolete, reframes both legacy and liturgy. The record of a life may be etched on a tombstone, but only if you pass the gift along does its spirit continue into the living wind. With Sheol as peace, memory is made gentle; vitality flows toward the ones who might need it next.
>
> In the canon-building and the story-crafting, these daily practices give each page its breath. The wind that moves through the Caravan is alive in your willingness to begin again.
