status: interpreted
confidence: plausible
rubric: Jonathan introduces his own leading hypotheses with regards to the meaning of the gospels. While Rommel surely doesn't "mean" the things Jonathan says, Jonathan's attempt to distinguish the ideas "saved directly", "saved only through fire" is earnest and interpretively plausible.
intent: An earnest, speculative attempt is made at imagining what Rommel 4:6 means, distinguishing direct salvation, salvation through ordeal, and progressive erasure/entropy in legacy. Interpreted examples of legacy and memory from scripture are included. Narrative reconstruction is hypothesized.

## Rommel 4:6 (quoted)

> In other words, to be saved directly or to be saved only through fire (eventually by undergoing a progressive eradication of one’s presence in eternal life to leave at most a disgusting memory - Deuteronomy 29:20 - John 6:47-50,51-58 - Numbers 14:21-23,27-32 - Luke 20:34-38).

### 1a. Interpreter's Exact Words (good4usoul-caene, 2025-11-21 04:45 Central Time)

> There seems to be a lot packed into these "In Other Words".  To be saved directly could be, for instance, to invoke John 3:16, and to "belive in the name of the only begotten son of God".  For me, I feel this belief in a name rather than the belief in the meaning of a name, represents the sort of belief that the dead actually accomplish, by having words engraved on their tombstone.  A lifeless belief, but one that ensures an honorable place in the land of the dead.  However, to believe in the meaning of Jesus, (that is, salvation) is to have a living belief.  One that not only believes in the sound of a word, but also believes in a concept, and follows that concept.  A person with this sort of belief will perform acts that are recognized by others and will be recognized in the future.  Now, as far as being saved through fire, this reminds me of the claims John the Baptist made, that "One who comes after me will baptize in fire and the holy spirit".  John the Baptist uses Tiresias oar for baptism.  The oar moves all the water along and pushes the boat forward.  But he said Jesus would baptise in fire and the holy spirit.  To me, it's a direct observable.  If a person reads Matthew, and says, okay, beatitudes... Sermon on the mount...  etc.  Good teaching, good advice.  His yolk is light.  He can stop right there, and he's the seed that fell along side the path.  It will take root and grow into the Holy Spirit.  other people read past Matthew, into Mark, and Luke, and they're not satisfied with what they see there, because they have a sign-seeking faith.  The faith of the adulterous generations.  They want to see signs, so that's what John's gospel gives them.  These people have failed the baptism of the holy spirit, and have taken the fire instead.  They will read John's gospel thinking that John-gospel-jesus is a rolemodel, when actually, he's a bit of a clown.  They will think he has wisdom, when actually he gives foolishness.

### 1b. Interpreter's Words (2025-11-21 11:52 Central Time) — Disgusting and Hidden Memories, Narrative Reconstruction

> Rommel 4:6 refers to "disgusting memories".  I think he is saying that disgusting memories may be erased over time, but I think that many disgusting memories may be preserved forever.  
>
> **Disgusting memories**, memories include [] Ezekiel 8-9, where the idol of jealousy orders a whole lot of innocent people to be slain and have their blood splashed across the temple walls.  [] All of Ezekiel, where he's cooking his food over bull-manure, [] Job 42, where Job becomes a monopolist, and values money over God.  [] Where Jacob has his men murder a bunch of people right after they have all committed themselves to his God, through circumcision.  [] Where babies heads are smashed against the walls  [] Where Elijah is tricked by Jezebel into bearing false witness against her husband, and then, Elijah invokes the Spirit of Baal, by condemning the as-yet-innocent unborn descendents.  [] Where Jezebel is "rewarded" in her service to Baal in a "Rumplestiltskin" sort of way; that is, her body is shattered and torn apart by wild dogs.  Much as Rumplestiltskin accomplished what he wanted (getting acknowledged as the father of the princess' first-born) and was destroyed by Baal, so did Jezebel accomplish what she swore to do, and was destroyed by Baal.  These memories are disgusting to me, because if we don't acknowledge the ironies, they present God as a murderer.  
>
> **Hidden memories**  Such "disgusting memories" shouldn't be confused with controversial moments of tender eros.  I'm not sure whether it is wise for Tiresias to point out the copulating snakes, but if the worst is that I'm transformed into a woman, for seven years, I'll take that chance.  [] In the scene when Jesus Barabbas puts his morsel in Judas' mouth, I'm reasonably convinced it was for circumcision, though this is more by faith (and careful heuristics of the gospels) than evidence.  [] Another hidden memory is in 1 or 2 Kings, when Jonathan and David meet in a cave and David bows before David three times.  Here, I'm fairly convinced that Jonathan and David were lovers.  [] Another hidden memory is in John 8:1-11, and if you read the original greek, he "writes with his digit in her soil" until all of the men watching feel compelled to leave.  And here, I'm fairly convinced that this was Jesus Barabbas, invoking the spirit of Diogenes, enjoying a prostitute in public, calling the bluff of the elders.

### 2a. Harmony Commentary

Rommel’s system might reframe afterlife as a matter of *durability* of contribution:
- To survive in “eternal life” is to have an enduring, positive influence.
- To fade is to be lost in entropy, your presence erased or left only as a negative aftertaste.
- “Salvation directly” is imagined as a living, concept-driven faith; “salvation through fire” as a more ambiguous, ordeal-tested legacy.
- “Disgusting memory” becomes a type of anti-legacy—when one’s impact is only negative or detrital.
This sidesteps the mythic architecture of heaven/hell as places, making them states of remembered consequence.

### 2b. Harmony Commentary – Scriptural Examples and Judas/Barabbas Narrative

#### Scriptural Examples – Disgusting and Hidden Memories

**Disgusting Memories (Preserved by Scripture)**
- Ezekiel 8–9: The “idol of jealousy” triggers mass slaughter, blood splashed across temple walls.
- Ezekiel’s rituals: Cooking food over bull manure, dramatizing abjection.
- Job 42: Job becomes a monopolist, valuing money over divine relationship—an ironic ending.
- Jacob’s vengeance: Jacob’s men murder converts right after they’re circumcised (Genesis 34).
- Infant atrocities: Babies’ heads smashed against walls (Psalm 137:9, et al.).
- Elijah’s curse: Jezebel tricks Elijah; he invokes the Spirit of Baal, condemning innocent unborn descendants.
- Jezebel’s fate: Her “Rumplestiltskin” reward—her body shattered by wild dogs (2 Kings 9:30–37).
  - Both Jezebel and Rumplestiltskin achieve their intended goals, but their ends are horrific.
- Divine irony: Without recognizing the narrative layers, these episodes can present God as a murderer—an unresolved moral tension in the text.

**Not to Be Confused With:** Tender or Erotic Controversy
- The Tiresias myth of copulating snakes: its threat is transformation, not moral horror.
- “If the worst is that I’m transformed into a woman for seven years, I’ll take that chance”—a risk of eros, not atrocity.

**Hidden Memories (Veiled or Suppressed in Canon)**
- Bara Bas and Judas: Barabbas gives Judas a morsel, possibly a circumcision ritual—more faith than textual evidence.
- Jonathan and David (Cave scene, 1/2 Kings): David bows three times before Jonathan; strong suggestion of lover’s intimacy.
- John 8:1–11 (Greek): Jesus “writes with his digit in her soil”; may be Jesus Barabbas channeling Diogenes, enjoying a prostitute in public, calling the bluff of the elders.

> **Canon Reflection:** Rommel’s idea that “disgusting memories” may fade does not always hold: abominable and ambiguous incidents persist in scripture and tradition, often never erased by time. Hidden memories similarly endure as narrative countercurrents or mythic reversals.

### 3a. Interpreter's Words (2025-11-21 11:52 Central Time) -  No Judas Betrayal Faith
> It might be appropriate here to mention how Judas' acts were required by prophecy, and by Jesus' own commands.   It is absurd that people (Including the author of the Gospel according to Biff, God love him) continue to pretend that Judas actually betrayed Jesus.  My "faith" (evidence of things hoped for) is that Judas, acting according to **Jesus' wishes**, and the **requirements of prophecy**, made the lamb, Jesus Barabbas "kosher" in an intimate act, in view of those who were coming out to arrest Jesus of Nazareth.  The foreskin is described as "Malchus ear" in some gospels.  And at the request of Caiaphas, who asked Jesus of Nazareth, "Heal my Son", Jesus of Nazareth convinced the gospelers to only provide the subtlest clues of what happened.  Some of this might be pretty poorly supported, but none of it directly conflicts with the words of the gospels, except for the metaphorical replacement of ear with foreskin.

### 3b. Harmony Commentary – Judas/Barabbas Narrative Reconstruction
- Judas’ acts were required by prophecy and by Jesus’ own command.
- The notion that Judas “betrayed” Jesus is narrative camouflage; his act enables the purification (“koshering”) of Jesus Barabbas, in view of those arresting Jesus of Nazareth.
- In some gospels, “Malchus’ ear” is a metaphor for the foreskin; the healing requested by Caiaphas is performed by Jesus of Nazareth, with gospel authors providing only the subtlest clues.
- This reconstruction is speculative, drawing more on interpretive faith and symbolic reading than direct textual support. It does not conflict with the canonical words except for the ear/foreskin metaphor.

## 4a. Interpreter’s Words – Judas’ Death, Fulfillment, and Tragic Fidelity

While Jesus' circumcision is no betrayal, I could add that perhaps Judas' suicide might have been a betrayal of sorts. If he had lived, there might have been, through him, an acknowledgement of the fulfillment of prophecy. As it is, though, he is the only one who followed the commands of Jesus Barabbas in John 6, "Drink of my blood, eat of my body." The text of John 6 states, "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day." Judas is the only one of Jesus' disciples who receives this honor. With his suicide or death, Judas ascends to heaven to be with Jesus immediately, instead of taking some time on earth that would have been helpful to establish God's kingdom on Earth.

## 4b. Harmony Commentary – Ritual Completion and Delay

- This interpretation reframes Judas as both faithful to Jesus' (Barabbas') most literal teaching, and tragically absent from the ongoing work of establishing the kingdom on Earth.
- His act is not betrayal of Christ, but perhaps a self-betrayal—abandoning earthly witness for anticipated eternal honor.
- Judas alone fulfills the ritual (John 6), securing the "raising up" and eternal life promised, but at the cost of leaving the disciples' witness incomplete.
- The narrative tension: ritual fulfilled, kingdom deferred.
- Raises narrative possibilities: how do we weigh completed rituals against the work of storytelling, community, and kingdom-building in the living world?
