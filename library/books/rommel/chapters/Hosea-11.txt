1 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 
2 But they turned away from those who called them [that is to say, from the prophets]. They sacrificed to the Baalim, and burned incense to idols. 
3 I guided the steps of Ephraim, taking them by their arms, but they did not understand that I was healing them. 
4 I led them with ropes, but they were ropes of love. I was to them as one who takes off the yoke on their jaws, in order to give them food. 
5 They will not return to the land of Egypt. But the Assyrian will be their king, because they have refused to return to me.  
6 And the sword will come against their cities, and will consume the bars of their gates, and devour them, because of their own counsels.
7 For my people desire to turn away from me. They are called to the Most High, but none of them exalts him. 
8 What will I do to you, Ephraim. How will I deliver you, Israel. Will I make you like Admah. Will I make you like Zeboiim. My heart is troubled within me, my compassions are kindled together. 
9 I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not destroy Ephraim. For I am God, and not a man. I am the holy one in your midst, and I will not come in fury. 
10 They will walk after Yahweh, who will roar like a lion. For he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west. 
11 They will come out of Egypt trembling like a bird, like a dove out of the land of Assyria. And I will make them dwell in their houses, says Yahweh. 
12 Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit. And Judah still has no restraint before God, before the faithful holy one.
