1 A psalm of David. The earth and everything on it belong to Yahweh. The world and those who dwell in it belong to him. 
2 For he has set its foundations on the seas, and established it on the rivers. 
3 Who will ascend to the mountain of Yahweh. Who will stand in his holy place. 
4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart. He who does not pervert his soul by futile behaviors, and does not swear deceitfully [to mislead some others without having publicly acceptable justifications in his heart]. 
5 He will receive a blessing from Yahweh, the mercy of the God of his salvation. 
6 This is the portion of those who seek him, of those who seek your face. This is Jacob. Pause. 
7 Lift up your heads, you the gates. Be lifted up, you the everlasting doors, and the king of glory will come in. 
8 Who is this king of glory. It is Yahweh, the one who is strong and mighty. Yahweh, the one who is mighty in battle. 
9 Lift up your heads, you the gates. Lift up yourselves, you the everlasting doors, and the king of glory will come in. 
10 Who is this king of glory. Yahweh the God of armies, he is the king of glory. Pause.
