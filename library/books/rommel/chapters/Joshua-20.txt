1 And Yahweh spoke to Joshua in the following words.
2 Speak to the children of Israel by saying: Establish cities of refuge for yourselves, as I commanded you by the hand of Moses. 
3 And the murderer who has killed someone unintentionally, without planning it, can escape there. They will be your refuge from the avenger of blood [the one who is appointed to this purpose].
4 And he who flees to one of these cities will stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause to the elders of the city. And they will receive him into the city, and give him a place so that he may dwell among them.
5 And if the avenger of blood pursues him, then they will not deliver the killer into his hand. For he struck his neighbor involuntarily and did not hate him at the time of event. 
6 But he will dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest who will be at that time. Then the killer will return and can come to his own city and to his own house, to the city from which he fled. 
7 So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee on the mount Naphtali, and Shechem on the mount Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba which is Hebron on the mountain of Judah. 
8 And on the other side of the Jordan towards Jericho eastward, they chose Bezer in wilderness on the plain of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. 
9 These were the cities that had been appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them, so that the one who has killed a person involuntarily may flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stands before the congregation for judgment.
