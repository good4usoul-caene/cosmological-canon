1 A psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. Show your brightness, you who sit between the cherubim. 
2 Deploy your strength to help the tribes of Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh. Come and save us. 
3 Come back to us, O God. Cause your face to shine on us, so that we may be saved. 
4 O Yahweh the God of armies, how long will you be angry at the prayer of your people. 
5 You have fed them with the bread of tears. You have given them plenty of tears to drink. 
6 You have made us an object of discord among our neighbors, and our enemies laugh at us among themselves. 
7 Come back to us, O God of armies. Cause your face to shine on us, and we will be saved. 
8 You have brought a vine out of Egypt, and you have driven out the nations to plant it. 
9 You made room for it, and you caused it to take root and to fill the land. 
10 The mountains were covered with its shadow, and its boughs were like the goodly cedars. 
11 It did spread out its shoots to the river Euphrates, and its branches to the sea. 
12 Why have you broken down its fences and allowed all the passerby to plunder it. 
13 The wild boar of the forest has ravaged it, and the wild beasts of the field have devoured it. 
14 We beseech you to come back to us, O God of armies. Look down from heaven and see, consider this vine. 
15 Look at the vineyard that your right hand has planted, the young vineyard that you have strengthened for yourself. 
16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down. They perish at the rebuke of your countenance. 
17 Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you have strengthened for yourself. 
18 And then we will no longer depart from you. Revive us, and we will call on your name.
19 Come back to us, O Yahweh the God of armies. Cause your face to shine on us, and we will be saved.
