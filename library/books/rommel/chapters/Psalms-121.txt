1 I lift up my eyes to the mountains. Where will my help come from. 
2 My help comes from Yahweh, the one who made the heaven and the earth. 
3 He will not suffer your foot to slip [since he has a plan for every one who loves his commandments]. For he who keeps you does not slumber. 
4 Behold, he who keeps Israel does neither slumber nor sleep. 
5 Yahweh is your keeper. Yahweh is your shadow at your right hand. 
6 The sun will not smite you by day, nor the moon by night. 
7 Yahweh will preserve you from all evil. He will preserve your soul. 
8 Yahweh will be in control of your goings out and your comings in, from now on and forever.
