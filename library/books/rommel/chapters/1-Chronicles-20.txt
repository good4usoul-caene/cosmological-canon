1 And the next year at the period when kings went out to war [because the climate is favorable], Joab went out with a strong army and destroyed the land of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah while David had stayed at Jerusalem. Then Joab and the army of Israel fought against the city of Rabbah until they destroyed it [when David had come to them]. 
2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found that it weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. And they did put it on David's head, and he also took a very large spoil from the city. 
3 And David brought out the people of the city and made them work with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And David did the same thing to all the cities of the children of Ammon, and then David and all the army went back to Jerusalem. 
4 And after that, there was a battle with the Philistines at Gezer. And Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai who was one of the sons of Rapha, and the Philistines were subdued. 
5 And there was again a battle with the Philistines. And Elhanan the son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear whose staff was like a weaver's beam. 
6 And there was again a battle at Gath, and there was a tall man who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty four [fingers and toes] in total. He was also the son of Rapha. 
7 And when he challenged Israel, then Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of David killed him. 
8 These men were born to Rapha in Gath, and they died by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
