1 And he said to me: Son of man, stand on your feet and I will speak to you. 
2 And when he spoke these words to me, the spirit entered into me and set me on my feet. And all my attention was for the voice that was speaking to me. 
3 And he said to me: Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me. They and their fathers have sinned against me to this very day. 
4 They are children of impudent faces and hardened hearts. I am sending you to them, and you will say to them: Thus speaks the Lord Yahweh. 
5 Whether they listen to you or not, for they are a rebellious house, they will know that there has been a prophet among them. 
6 And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them and do not be afraid of their words, although the people around you are like briers and thorns, although you dwell with scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words and do not be dismayed by their faces, although they are a rebellious house. 
7 You will tell them my words, whether they listen to you or not. For they are rebellious. 
8 And you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like this rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I give you. 
9 And I looked, and behold, a hand was stretched toward me. And lo, it was holding a scroll with words written on it. 
10 And the hand did spread the scroll before me, and it was written inside and out. And there were written lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
