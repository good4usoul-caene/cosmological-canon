1 Prophetic song. We will be like those who dream, when Yahweh brings back the captives of Zion. 
2 Our mouth will be filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. And the peoples of the nations will say: Yahweh has done great things for them. 
3 Indeed, Yahweh will do great things for us and we will be happy. 
4 Bring back prosperity, O Yahweh. Make us feel like an arid land on which rivers are brought. 
5 Now, those who sow while being sad will reap while being happy. 
6 He who carries the seeds despite the troubles that make him weep, will joyfully carry the sheaves.
