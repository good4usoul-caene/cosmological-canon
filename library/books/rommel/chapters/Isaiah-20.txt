1 In the year that Tartan came and besieged Ashdod, and captured it, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him to do it. 
2 At that time Yahweh spoke to Isaiah the son of Amoz by saying: Go now and untie the sackcloth from around your waist, and take your shoes off your feet. And Isaiah did so, and he was walking naked and barefoot. 
3 Then Yahweh said: My servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years, for a sign and wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia. 
4 For the king of Assyria will carry away captives from Egypt, and captives from Ethiopia, both young and old. They will be naked and barefoot, their buttocks will be uncovered in order to shame Egypt. 
5 And there will be fear and confusion for those who trust in Ethiopia and hope in the glory of Egypt. 
6 And the inhabitants of this coast will say in that day: This is what our hope has become, those to whom we hoped to flee to be saved from the hand of the king of Assyria. And now, how will we be saved.
