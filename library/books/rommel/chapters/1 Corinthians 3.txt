1 And I, brothers, I have not spoken to you as to spiritual people, but as to carnal people, as to babes in Christ. 
2 I have fed you with milk, not with solid food. For you did not yet have the ability to bear it, and until now you still cannot. 
3 For you are still carnal. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not carnal, and do you not act like ordinary people of the world. 
4 When one says, 'I am of Paul', and another says, 'I am of Apollos', are you not carnal. [Now these strange discussions come from the fact that no one knows the exact definition of eternal life in those days, but only the definition of faith.] 
5 Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul. They are simply servants of Christ, and their only goal is to make known the unique message of the gospel of Christ, and it is through these servants that you have believed in the truth of the gospel according to the measure of faith that God has given to each of you. 
6 I planted the seed, and Apollos watered it. But God is the one who made the seed grow. 
7 So it is not the one who plants who is anything, nor the one who waters, but the one who is important is God who makes grow. 
8 He who plants and he who waters have the same purpose, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 
9 For we are laborers together for God. And you are like a field belonging to God, like a house that God is building. 
10 According to the grace of God given to me, I have been like a wise master builder. I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But each person has to be careful concerning how he builds on it. 
11 For no one can lay a foundation other than the one that has been laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
12 Now people can build on that foundation using gold, or silver, or precious stones, or wood, or hay, or stubble. 
13 But the work of each person will be made manifest. For the day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire. For the fire will test the work of each person, to reveal what kind it is. 
14 If the work that a person has built on that foundation survives, then he will receive a reward. 
15 If the work of a person is burned, then he will lose his reward. He will be saved, but only as through a fire. 
16 Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you. 
17 If anyone destroys the temple of God, then God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, and you yourselves are that temple. 
18 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this world, then he should become a fool so that he may become wise. 
19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the sight of God. For it is written: He catches the wise in their own craftiness. 
20 And also: The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise [that is to say, those who are wise according to their own standards and not according to a blind faith in Christ], he knows that they are futile. 
21 Therefore let no one among the believers seeks his own glory in certain particular persons [that is to say, you must flee all forms of idolatry]. For all things are yours. 
22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, everything is yours. 
23 And you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
