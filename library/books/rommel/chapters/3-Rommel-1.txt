1 Preface to the Testament of Jesus Christ, first part. 
2 Until now it is not obvious to differentiate between Yahweh and his angels (Genesis 16:11-13 - 28:12-13 - 31:11-13 - Exodus 33:8-23 - Joshua 5:13-15 - Judges 2:1-5 - 5:23 - 6:11-13,14-17 - 13:1-25 - Zechariah 3:1-7 - 4 Rommel 4:6). And the biblical characters are aware that what they call God is a multitude of angels (Genesis 18:1-2 - 19:1 - 32:1-2) who are completely united in their purpose (Deuteronomy 6:4 - Jeremiah 9:23-24 - 23:23-24). 
3 And everything in the universe happens by the hand of the one God (Deuteronomy 32:39 - Exodus 18:14-24 - 1 Kings 22:31-33 - 2 Chronicles 18:30-32 - 2 Kings 5:1 - 24:1-4 - 25:1-7 - Ezekiel 12:1-16 - Isaiah 45:5-7 - Amos 9:7 - Jeremiah 52:1-3). 
4 How could a good and merciful God ask Abraham to kill his child (Genesis 22:1-18). 
5 This God who considers only the information available to us (Genesis 20:1-6 - Numbers 14:22-23 - Deuteronomy 11:1-9 - 31:9-13 - John 15:22 - Luke 10:1-12,13-15), wants to know if this Abraham truly believes him to be almighty. 
6 And Abraham already knows a number of things about the origin of this child (Genesis 15:1-6 - 21:1-4) and also the events of Sodom and Gomorrha (Genesis 18). 
7 And it is through the coming of Jesus of Nazareth that the exact identity of God will be revealed (Romans 16:24-27 - Acts 2:14-36 - Colossians 1:26-27).
8 The name of an entity is not any literal expression but the knowledge of the precise object which is designated, in other words the abstract concept that it represents (Exodus 2:16-18 - 3:1 - 6:1-3 - Genesis 31:44-49 - Leviticus 20:1-3 - 22:1-3 - Jeremiah 34:13-16 - Ezekiel 20:39 - Numbers 13:16 - Deuteronomy 3:9 - 10:20 - 14:22-23 - John 17:25-26 - Acts 2:21 - 4:12 - 4 Rommel 4:12 - 11:29-30). 
9 Moreover different things can be called by the same name as we see with Goshen in Egypt (Genesis 45:9-10 - 47:1-6 - Exodus 8:22 - 9:26) and Goshen in the territory under the control of Israel (Joshua 11:16). Moreover there are two Mephibosheth in the family of Saul (2 Samuel 21:7-8) and there are two Goliath in Gath (1 Samuel 17:4 - 2 Samuel 21:19).
10 The word God is a holy trinity which designates indifferently the Father or the Son or the holy spirit (4 Rommel 11:17-18). They are three completely distinct identities and at each occurrence of an implicit or explicit reference to God in a sentence of a biblical verse, only one of these identities is implicitly designated (4 Rommel 4:15-17) and it may happen that all three appear distinctly in a same biblical verse (Luke 10:21 - John 14:26 - 15:26 - 2 Corinthians 13:14). So we have the Father of all creation (Jeremiah 32:17-19), and the Son who is the information created in the world by Jesus of Nazareth (John 2:19-21 - It is alluded to the temple in this reference, namely the temple of God), and the holy spirit who is the father of Jesus of Nazareth according to the flesh (Luke 1:35) and also the spiritual father of all those who accept a new birth of their minds in order to become spiritual children of Jesus of Nazareth (John 8:26-27,28-29 - 4 Rommel 11:24-25) and in this way the spiritual children of the patriarch Jacob because he is present as a model in the genealogy of the teaching transmitted by Jesus de Nazareth. [Jacob was renamed Israel by the angels of the holy spirit during his life in the flesh.]
11 And because human beings are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), they have the right to change their minds when new information comes to their attention (1 Samuel 2:30 - 4 Rommel 10:14-16). [But at a time when the exact identity of God was still unknown, that is to say before Jesus Christ, even new information could not justify a change of mind concerning an oath that was made to Yahweh himself (Jeremiah 34:1-7,8-22 - Deuteronomy 23:21-23).]
12 God the Father does not change his mind but the holy spirit and his angels can change their minds and repent (Genesis 6:5-6 - Exodus 32:14 - Jonah 3 - Jeremiah 18:1-10,11-13 - 26:1-6,7-15 - 36:1-4) because they only consider the information actually accumulated up to the present moment (Deuteronomy 31:21 - 1 Kings 2:19-23). This is how changes were made to the territory that was allocated by lot to the tribe of Judah (Numbers 26:52-56 - Joshua 14:1-5 - 15:1 - 19:1,9 - Proverbs 16:33). 
13 But God the Father does not allow any of the words of the holy spirit, the holy one of Israel, to remain without any effect (1 Samuel 13:13-14 - 15:28-29 - 1 Kings 8:56 - 12:15 - Isaiah 55). Indeed, in the final state of the universe we will no longer be made of flesh and blood hence the effectiveness of the flood (Genesis 6:5-8), and his threat on the destruction of the people that he addressed to Moses was accomplished by the fact that Jesus Christ put an end to the twelve tribes by uniting all humanity (Exodus 32:14), and his threat against the inhabitants of Nineveh caused a change in their behavior (Jonah 3). 
14 And those who asked by themselves to become servants of the God of Israel [and therefore renounced their idolatry practices] escaped a destruction that had been ordered and they were even defended (Joshua 9 - 10), while the others were destroyed by Joshua himself when he still had the strength to wage war against those of their enemies who have not been protected by God (Exodus 23:27-33 - Joshua 11:18-23 - 13:1-8 - 15:63 - 16:10 - 17:12-13). 
15 In the same way that the children of Jacob clung to Yahweh only during certain periods (Judges 2), one can think that some of the nations who lived in their midst had a similar behavior in their relations with the holy spirit (Deuteronomy 20:10-12 - Joshua 21:43-45 - 23:1-16 - Numbers 33:50-56). 
16 The holy spirit is an unchanging notion (Genesis 41:37-39 - Numbers 11:24-29 - 24:1-4 - 1 Samuel 16:13-14 - Psalms 51:10-12 - Acts 28:25-29 - 2 Peter 1:21 - Luke 1:8-15,41-42,67-75), but the words of his angels and the laws that they enunciate are circumstantial and are based solely on available knowledge and technology (Job 39:1-2 - Amos 3:6 - Ezekiel 20:23-25 - Acts 7:51-53). And God the Father is the originator of everything that happens (Job 38:39-41). The book of Job is only about God the Father on the one hand, and on the other hand about his holy spirit which expresses itself through two of the characters (Job and Elihu) and also through the angel who speaks in the conclusion of the book.  
17 The goal of life is obedience to the holy spirit and to transmit this teaching there have been many prophets including David (1 Chronicles 29:10-19), the main role being that of Jesus of Nazareth who is called the Son of man or the Son of God (1 John 5:10-13,20-21 - John 10:33-36 - John 3:16 - Isaiah 40 - 4 Rommel 11:31 - 12:41-44,45-47 - Acts 14:8-20 - 17:22-34 - 2 Corinthians 13:14). [It is not essential to seek to prove that Jesus has really exists and has said what he is supposed to have said. For one can simply affirm that the person who is at the origin of the final form of all the books of the bible is God the creator of all things because this person deserves that we obey to the only useful teaching which is transmitted (this person is for us a father - 4 Rommel 6:22-23 - 11:24-25 - 5 Rommel 5:42-43), and the bible tells us that it is the holy spirit who is the author of each unadulterated book (3 Rommel 1:16). The notion of holy spirit does not change over time because it is only a matter of knowing why you do what you do and not what you do, for the holy spirit only considers the information that is available to each person in real time (Philippians 4:8 - 1 Corinthians 14:20 - Luke 18:15-17,18-22,28-30 - Malachi 3:1-6,7-18 - 4 Rommel 12:70 - Galatians 4:1-12), and all offenses against the holy spirit must have consequences by receiving a proportional punishment even if they are committed before the reception of the exact knowledge of God (Exodus 23:1-9 - Deuteronomy 1:16-17 - 4 Rommel 3:12 - 7:33 - 4 Rommel 14:1-4), but we can distinguish two categories of people who have a form of holy spirit within them. On the one hand there are those who want to do what is good but do not know exactly what to do because they are ignorant of the exact message of the Jesus Christ, and since the beginning of humanity this form of holy spirit can exist in certain persons regardless of their genealogies and the beliefs of their communities, and those who had received the law of Moses simply witnessed certain events that justify that they had to trust that law and transmit it to their spiritual children who are mostly their children according to the flesh in those days (Numbers 15:13-16,29-31 - Exodus 12:48-49 - Leviticus 24:17-22 - Deuteronomy 4:9-10), and this has always been the procedure even before the law of Moses (3 Rommel 1:4-6 - Genesis 17:1-13,23-27 - Romans 4:1-13 - 4 Rommel 12:24-25), and on the other hand there are those to whom the exact message of Jesus Christ has been declared and who no longer have any excuse if they do not do what is good since it is no longer allowed to have doubts about the exact identity of God (4 Rommel 12:14-15). For it is natural for a person to have doubts when that person has not yet received the exact understanding of the message of Jesus Christ. # For example Manasseh became king when he was still a teenager, and he did not think that the glory of Hezekiah his father (2 Kings 18:1-7 - 2 Chronicles 32:32-33) had come from the desire to please Yahweh by conforming to all the subtleties and nuances of the law of Moses (2 Chronicles 33:1-10). But Manasseh eventually changed his mind (2 Chronicles 33:11-20). There is another person who had doubts, and he died according to the flesh without changing his mind since we do not have the memory of his repentance, and it is Ahaz the father of Hezekiah (2 Kings 16:1-20 - 2 Chronicles 28:1-8,16-25). # Another example is Solomon when he was old, since his many foreign wives caused him to have doubts about how he was supposed to serve Yahweh, Yahweh being the God of all flesh who had prophets outside the tribes of Israel like Balaam (Numbers 22 - Now the name Yahweh must not have been known by Balaam since it was not given until the days of Moses, but it is Moses who is supposed to have rewritten the story of Balaam - Numbers 22:18 - and the name of an entity is simply an abstract concept - 3 Rommel 1:8 - Daniel 4:8 - Malachi 2:17 - In addition, the word God which appears in the modern translations of the Old Testament is a translation of the word Elohim of the ancient Hebrew, and Elohim is the one who causes all things to happen, and Yahweh is simply the holy spirit of Elohim who has imposed the trinity in his holy scriptures by saying that he himself is Elohim and the only Elohim). But the doubts of Solomon were not a form of holy spirit but rather a transgression because of what he already knew (Exodus 21:28-29 - 1 Chronicles 28:9 - 1 Rommel 1:36). # Another example is Gideon and his father. For Gideon was one of the children of Israel from whom Yahweh also raised up prophets (Judges 6:1-10), and Gideon simply had some knowledge of the history of his people, of how God had formed his people, and Gideon became a prophet because he had a conversation with the angels of Yahweh (Judges 6:11-17,18-24,33-40 - 4 Rommel 4:8). And one can think that the father of Gideon also had some doubts about the proper way to worship the God of all the peoples of the earth, a God who had prophets outside the tribes of Israel like Job (3 Rommel 1:27), since the father of Gideon owned a place of worship for Baal (Judges 6:25-32). Now the doubt of Zacharias the father of John the Baptist was not a form of holy spirit but rather a transgression (Luke 1:5-20), since Zacharias was in the temple of Yahweh at the time of his vision, in front of the only altar of incense which is inside the holy place and before the most holy place.] 
18 Jesus of Nazareth is the only perfect human being (1 Timothy 2:5 - John 8:23 - Philippians 2:1-11).
19 The holy spirit is found primarily in the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, and it is this spirit that was on all the prophets of God but the distributed gifts vary (4 Rommel 12:47-49). 
20 Balaam the prophet was always waiting for the angels of God to interact with him (Numbers 22:5-13 - 23:1-6,13-17) and later he was temporarily overwhelmed by the purity of the spirit and then he prophesied without the perceptible intermediary of the angels (Numbers 24:1-4). 
21 However Balaam was not perfect like any ordinary human being (1 Rommel 3:20) and was seduced at a time which was not specified (Numbers 25 - 31:7-16). At a time when the exact identity of God is still unknown, the intention was to distance the people of Israel from the commandments of Yahweh in the hope that Yahweh will destroy a part of them for this abandonment. Consequently the response was proportional to the fault. And Balaam had already offended God before this event because he had consulted God twice for the same reason without having received any new additional information (Numbers 22:14-19 - 2 Peter 2:15-16), since the only additional information was that he was offered an increase in his reward for accomplishing the same mission. [Now David consulted God twice for a same reason without having any new information at his disposal, but he certainly did not do it by the same method (1 Samuel 23:1-6) since he was not recognized as a prophet in his time according to the definition of a prophet in his time (2 Samuel 24:11 - 1 Chronicles 21:9 - 2 Chronicles 29:25 - 1 Samuel 9:9 - 2 Samuel 24:16-19 - 1 Chronicles 21:15-21 - 4 Rommel 4:8). For David could sometimes receive messages through dreams (1 Samuel 28:6,15), and it was known in his time that a person can express himself through the spirit of Yahweh by doing what is pleasing to Yahweh, even if that person does not have regular conversations with the angels of Yahweh (2 Samuel 7:1-3 - 23:1-2 - 1 Chronicles 17:1-2 - 3 Rommel 1:16). Now Solomon the son of David was a prophet since the angels of Yahweh have explicitly spoken with Solomon twice (1 Kings 3:5,15 - 9:1-2 - 11:9-10 - 2 Chronicles 1:6-7 - 7:11-12), but Yahweh have also spoken to Solomon through other prophets (1 Kings 6:9-14 - 11:11-12), because in reality the prophets are ordinary persons who have the will to do what is right according to the information at their disposal (Ecclesiastes 7:28-29) but who are not as perfect as Jesus Christ (1 Kings 13:1-10,11-19,20-24,25-32 - 1 Rommel 3:20).] 
22 For every person who allows oneself to be overwhelmed by the spirit speaks the words of the spirit (Ecclesiastes 12:10-14), even a woman like Miriam the sister of Moses (Exodus 2:1-10 - 1 Chronicles 6:1-3 - Exodus 15:20-21 - Micah 6:3-5) and others (Genesis 16:7-13 - Judges 4:4-9 - 2 Kings 22:12-15 - Nehemiah 6:14 - Galatians 3:28). That is why there may be favorable circumstances for the flourishing of the spirit [such as listening to soothing music that is either wordless or whose words are meaningful and without sadness (2 Kings 3:14-16), or engaging in activities that are not designed to excel through physical effort]. Thus there have been schools to learn to behave constantly in a manner pleasing to the spirit at a time when the exact identity of God was unknown, and the complex commandments of Moses which also concerned the functions of the tribe of Levi in Israel was still in force (1 Kings 20:35,38 - 2 Kings 2:1-3 - 4:38-41 - 9:1-10). Such a school is open to all, absolutely everyone, while it is only the genealogy that allows one to belong to the family of the sons of Aaron who are the only ones who can become priests among all the members of the tribe of Levi and even among all the children of Israel according to the law given by Moses (Jeremiah 4:9 - 5:31 - 6:13 - 13:13 - 23:33-34 - 26:4-8 - 28:1-17 - 32:32 - 2 Samuel 23:1-2 - 3 Rommel 1:19-20 - 1 Samuel 28:6,15 - 1 Rommel 3:11-12). The distinction between being a prophet (Deuteronomy 18:15-19,20-22 - 4 Rommel 12:47-49 - Isaiah 1:1-4) and being a priest (Exodus 29:29-30 - Numbers 18:1-7,8-20,21-24,25-32) is further emphasized in 2 Kings 22:8-15 and in Haggai 1:1-12,13-14 - 2:1-5,10-15,20-23, and the function of the high priest Joshua (Ezra 3:8-9 - 5:1-2 - Haggai 1:1-4) is clarified in a vision of the prophet Zechariah (Zechariah 3:1-8 - 4:6-10) and out of that vision by the word of Yahweh given to the same prophet Zechariah (Zechariah 6:9-13), and also in Jeremiah 29:20-33 which contains a letter sent from Babylon to Jerusalem and addressed to the priests who serve in the house of Yahweh (Deuteronomy 16:18-20 - 17:8-13), since Jeremiah the prophet is not such a priest despite the fact that he is the son of a priest who has lived in the land of the tribe of Benjamin (Jeremiah 1:1-10). And we also see the humor of Yahweh when we compare the content of Haggai 1:12-14 - 2:1-5 and that of John 11:45-51. [Paul does not say that a woman should not have responsibilities in society (Romans 16:1-2,12-15 - Galatians 3:28) but he recommends that they should not be teachers of the exact knowledge of God's behavior in a context where structured assemblies are created (4 Rommel 6:33-35 - 11:22) for the purpose of facilitating the acquisition of the holy spirit by the propagation of the Hebrew scriptures which are not accessible to most people in those days (1 Corinthians 14:34-38 - 1 Timothy 2:9-15). There may be exceptions but Paul prefers that this not be the case because in a general way the intentions of the one who teaches and of some of those who listen will not necessarily be sincere (3 Rommel 1:44).]
23 Some people may have particular abilities with more or less regularity either through the holy spirit (Exodus 31:1-5 - 35:30-35 - Numbers 23:1-6,13-17 - 1 Samuel 9:14-19 - 2 Kings 5:1-8 - 6:8-12 - Daniel 5:11-12), or only by the will of God the Father who wants to accomplish his purposes (Exodus 22:18 - Leviticus 19:31 - 20:6-7,26-27 - Deuteronomy 13:1-5 - 18:9-14 - 1 Samuel 16:13-16). 
24 He who obeys God is a child of God, and he who does not obey him is not his child (Romans 8:14). Each one must constantly consider that everything around oneself is a distraction and cling only to the holy spirit (1 John 2:15-17), in other words each person must focus on why he does what he does and not on what he does (Luke 4:1-13). 
25 It is not what we do that interests God, since we have the right to do whatever we want (1 Corinthians 3:21-23 - Job 35:1-8 - 1 John 2:24-26,27-29 - Luke 11:52), but only the reasons why we do it (4 Rommel 1:8-9 - 8:13-15 - 4 Rommel 2:60 - Genesis 12:9-20 - 20:1-13 - 26:1-11 - 37:1-36 - 42:1-26 - 43:1-15 - 44:1-13 - Job 32:1-3 - Joshua 22:22-29 - 1 Samuel 18:25 - 21:10-15 - 1 Kings 3:16-25 - 2 Kings 2:15-18 - 3:26-27 - 4:13-23,24-26,27-28 - 5:15-19 - 20:1-11 - 2 Samuel 14:1-4,18-21 - 15:32-37 - 16:15-19 - 1 Chronicles 12:16-17 - Luke 11:37-41 - 2 Samuel 22:27-28 - Ezra 7:8-10 - 8:21-23,24-34 - Nehemiah 4 - Jeremiah 38:14-16,24-28 - 4 Rommel 2:27-28 - 12:50-52 - 1 Corinthians 9:19-27 - 5 Rommel 5:48-50). God only wants to know whether a person’s motivation is PUBLICLY justifiable in the mind of that person, or whether that person is aware of being unable to justify himself in a situation that would require it and in the presence of a being who knows everything (Luke 4:40-41 - 9:20-22 - 22:54-62 - John 17:11-12). Moses wonders how God will accomplish what he has declared (Numbers 11:21-23) while the officer of Jehoram king of Israel affirms that God will not be able to accomplish the word that he has spoken by the prophet Elisha (2 Kings 7:17-20). And at a time when the exact identity of God is still unknown, Solomon specifies that he does not want to build a house to make Yahweh live there but only to carry out the commandments that Yahweh gave to Moses (2 Chronicles 2:4-6). For the God of Israel only considers the information available to each person (Genesis 20:1-6 - Numbers 14:22-23 - Deuteronomy 11:1-9 - 31:9-13 - John 15:22 - Luke 10:1-12,13-15).
26 Certain communities in the past like the Egyptians could know the notion of eternal life but without knowing the right procedure to truly continue to exist in the hearts of humans (4 Rommel 12:60-61 - John 21:15-17 - 2 Corinthians 4:12-18). 
27 The law of Moses was not known before him (Exodus 30:12-16 - 34:19-25 - Leviticus 25:23-34 - Numbers 15:22-23 - Ezekiel 20:10-14 - Nehemiah 9:7-14). And each community had its own habits for it is evident that Job did not belong to the tribes of Israel (Deuteronomy 12:13-14 - Job 1:1-5 - 42:7-9,12-15 - Numbers 27:1-11 - Genesis 34:14-17 - Judges 14:10). And the promises made to Abraham were formulated before the circumcision which rewarded his integrity (Genesis 12:1-4 - Genesis 17:10-14,22-27 - Romans 4:13).
28 The only message of the Bible is that it was Jesus Christ who clearly revealed the existence and exact knowledge of the concept of eternal life to all those who could still doubt it (John 3:16 - Luke 17:20-21 - 1 Corinthians 15:1-11 - 1 Peter 1:24-25 - 1 John 1:1-4). For he was resurrected and he no longer died after that, he lives in the hearts of all his disciples in accordance with all his words in the gospel of John (Galatians 2:20-21 - Ephesians 1:22-23 - 2 Corinthians 5:17-18 - 3 Rommel 2:15). 
29 He does not live in the body of one who is not his disciple (Romans 8:9 - 2 Corinthians 13:5). 
30 And he also revealed the right way to find an admirable place in eternal life, that is by following his example and constantly clinging to the holy spirit (Leviticus 7:11-18 - 19:5-6 - 22:29-30 - Amos 4:1-5 - Leviticus 10:1-7,16-20 - Numbers 10:29-33 - 32:1-5,16-23 - 2 Corinthians 3:12-18 - 1 Samuel 4:1-22 - 7:1-17 - 1 Chronicles 21:28-30 - Joshua 22 - Colossians 1:24-29 - John 5:39-40 - Luke 7:23-30,31-35). 
31 The patriarchs dedicated to God each of the places where they met his angels (Genesis 12:6-9 - 26:24-25 - 28:16-22 - 35:6-7,8-15). And later Moses built a house for God, a movable structure made according to the plans shown to him by God (Exodus 25:1-9). This is the tabernacle [the dwelling] which contained the ark of the covenant in which were placed the ten commandments written on tablets of stones (Exodus 25:16,21). And the tabernacle was created only to be an answer to the transgression of the people who have made a god that they could see with their eyes while Moses had gone to the mountain (1 Rommel 3:16).
32 And by disobeying Moses' command not to add or subtract anything from the laws (Deuteronomy 4:1-2), David replaced the tabernacle with a fixed house which was to be different at least in the structure of the openings (Exodus 26:1-6,7-15 - 1 Kings 6 - 2 Chronicles 3–4). And we see that Solomon who actually built this temple has celebrated the creation of God in the courtyard according the plans given to him by his father David who is the first to have wanted to make the ark of God dwell in a more comfortable structure (2 Samuel 7:1-3 - 1 Kings 8:17-20 - 1 Chronicles 28:9-21). Solomon made a container called the sea which rested on representations of bulls, although Moses was asked for a simple basin for washing with its base (Exodus 30:17-21 - 1 Kings 7:23-26 - 2 Chronicles 4:1-6). And Solomon made ten tables for the showbreads and ten candlesticks (1 Kings 7:48 - 1 Chronicles 23:27-30 - 28:15-16 - 2 Chronicles 4:7-8,19-20) that did not continue to exist in the same number (1 Kings 14:23-27), although it had been asked to Moses to make only one table for the showbreads (Exodus 25:23-30 - Numbers 4:4-8 - 1 Samuel 21:1-6 - 1 Chronicles 9:32 - Luke 6:4) and only one candlestick (Exodus 25:31-40 - Numbers 4:9-10). And Solomon made two special pillars used only for the decoration and who each had received a name as if it were a man (Jachin and Boaz) after their tops had been cluttered with several ornaments (1 Kings 7:13-22 - 2 Chronicles 3:15-17). And in this context of freedom (1 Kings 7:40-45 - 2 Kings 16:7-18), Solomon had an impressive throne made to visually describe the severity of his impartial judgment (1 Kings 7:7-8 - 10:18-20 - 2 Chronicles 9:17-19). [Kings do not come from the tribe of Levi which contains the priests the descendants of Aaron, and the throne of Solomon (1 Kings 7:1-12) cannot be located in the house of God which is created solely for the work of the priests and the other Levites (1 Rommel 3:22-23,30-32)] 
33 What is to be remembered about the queen of Sheba (1 Kings 10:1-13 - 2 Chronicles 9:1-12) are not the details of the things that entice the eyes, because everything has been carried away by the wind from the reign of Rehoboam who was the immediate successor of Solomon his father (1 King 14:25-27) until the destruction of the kingdom of Judah (not the whole population but the social organization - 2 Kings 25:1-7 - Hosea 13:11). For what is to be remembered is the spirit of justice through which Solomon had consideration even for his servants, because it is only the works of the spirit of justice that endure eternally (4 Rommel 1:24). That is why the queen of Sheba said in other words: 'God wants to give an eternal legacy to this people Israel who currently live in this territory, because he loves them. Consequently, God has established a king over them who has enough intelligence to induce his people to make righteous judgments in all disputes that may arise'. It is the message that the prophet Isaiah gave in the time of some evil and good kings of the kingdom of Judah (Isaiah 1). And it is also the message that the prophet Zechariah gave to those who had just returned to the land of Judah from Babylon where the people had been taken captive during the destruction of the kingdom of Judah, a people who have rebuilt the house of God [this second house will be destroyed nearly forty years after the death of Jesus of Nazareth who therefore lived under the law of Moses (4 Rommel 12:50-51)] but no longer established a kingdom (Zechariah 8 - 3 Rommel 2:18). Indeed, if one wishes to obtain a place of any nature in eternity, possibly after the death of the flesh (2 Kings 20:1-3 - Jeremiah 22:1-9,13-19), one must not seek to understand the intentions of God but one must only be satisfied with acting continuously with fairness (Proverbs 3:1-7 - 4 Rommel 11:23 - 12:62-65 - Psalms 45:6-7 - 89:14-18 - Luke 1:67-75,76-79 - 11:29-36 - 1 Peter 1:24-25 - 1 Rommel 3:14). 
34 And later Ezekiel gave complete laws for a fixed house dedicated to God, contradicting Moses on several aspects (Ezekiel 43:10-12) and even on the offerings that must be made to God [Only the obligatory part of burnt offerings, and burnt offerings are not eaten (4 Rommel 13). For there is no fixed date in advance for the sacrifices that are eaten and they are not affected by Ezekiel’s changes (4 Rommel 7:13-20,21-24)]. 
35 And according to Ezekiel we will no longer observe a grouping of the territories attributed to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to a part of the tribe of Manasseh (Numbers 32:28-33 - 34:1-12,13-15 - Joshua 1:12-15 - 14:1-5 - 17:1-6 - 18:5-7 - Ezekiel 47:21-23 - 48:1-8,22-29). Simeon was formerly a neighbor of Judah (Joshua 19:1,9) but according to Ezekiel, his new neighbors must be Benjamin and Issachar (Ezekiel 48:24-25). Nevertheless a continuity is observed through the proximity of Manasseh and Ephraim which are two distinct benedictions within Joseph (Ezekiel 48:4-6). But previously, some could have cities that belonged to them in the territory of others and this was not just about the first two sons of Joseph (Joshua 16:4-9 - 17:7-11). And Levi had no territory but only cities in the territories of everyone from the beginning (Deuteronomy 10:8-9 - 18:1-2 - Numbers 35:1-8), but it will no longer be the case (Ezechiel 48:8-22).
36 There is a remarkable quote that comes from the Babylonian Talmud which would have been designed nearly four centuries after Jesus Christ, the second work of its kind after the Jerusalem Talmud which would have been designed a few decades after Jesus Christ [and which consequently is more perverse because of the context of persecution, the rejection of christianity and the destruction of the jewish temple, the destruction of that second jewish temple having taken place because they revolted against the authority of the Romans in the same way that the revolt of Zedekiah the last king of Judah against the authority of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had caused the destruction of the first temple built by Solomon king of Israel]. Each Talmud is an association of the Mishnah and its comments by some people, and a set of comments is called Gemara. And the Mishnah is established after Jesus Christ and is presumed to be an oral law continuously transmitted for generations and absolutely necessary for the understanding of the jewish torah, namely the Hebrew Bible called Tanakh which contains the Torah of Moses called the Torah [for the meaning of the word torah is teaching or doctrine or instruction]. This quote says: David and Job and Ezekiel have described the length of the Torah without putting a number to it.  
37 And Ezekiel is the only and unique prophet after Moses (Genesis - Exodus - Leviticus - Numbers - Deuteronomy) who enunciated new laws for the family of Jacob named Israel (Ezekiel 40 – 48), for all the other prophets simply made known the promises of God which concerned certain intervals of time of the future in relation to the time of their proclamation. However, in order to bear witness to significant events that can be useful in instructing others about what behaviors they should or should not have in their relationship with God, certain commemorations were instituted (Judges 11:30-40 - 2 Kings 25:8-10 - Zechariah 7:1-5 - Esther 9:20-32 - John 10:22-24) for the people who were united by the desire for a rigorous practice of the law of Moses. For some of them have even left their lands which had been given to them by Yahweh (Numbers 36 - Ezekiel 46:16-18), and have gone to dwell where they would have the opportunity to practice the commandments of which they had knowledge (2 Chronicles 11:1-12,13-17 - 15:8-9). [And concerning the different ways of bearing witness to an event, there were circumstantial habits that were initiated in particular contexts in order to bear witness to certain oaths (Ruth 4:7-8). And in a more distant past, some communities had a special way of ensuring that a promise would not be easily forgotten by the mind of the one who made it (Genesis 24:1-4,7-9 - 47:29-31). And the reason of the realization of a fasting in the ninth month of the fifth year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah has not been indicated (Jeremiah 36:5-10). And we see that during the days of Jesus Christ, women have a certain habit (Luke 7:36-39 - John 12:1-2,3-8).]
38 For the writings of Moses do not contradict each other (Genesis 7:17-24 - 8:1-5). However, according to the nature of Yahweh who is mischievous and without wickedness, different details are sometimes provided elsewhere (Leviticus 4:13-14 - Numbers 15:24-26 - Deuteronomy 1:42-46 - Judges 11:14-17 - Numbers 20:14-21 - 2 Samuel 4:6,7 - 1 Chronicles 8:29-32 - 9:35-38 - 1 Samuel 25:28-31 - 1 Chronicles 11:1-3 -  1 Chronicles 16:1-7 - 2 Chronicles 29:25) and this reveals the flexibility of the commandments since everyone simply has to do his best. 
39 For instance, it was previously recommended that six cities of refuge be established to shelter those who have committed justifiable murder (Numbers 35:6-7), and three of these cities were before the Jordan (Numbers 34:13-15 - 35:9-15 - Deuteronomy 4:20-22,41-49) outside the land of Canaan. However during the summary speeches which were given at the end of the journey of the children of Jacob in the wilderness, from the eleventh month of the fortieth and final year (Exodus 7:7 - Numbers 20:22-29 - 26:63-65 - 33:36-39 - Deuteronomy 1:1-5 - 3:18-29 - Numbers 27:12-14 - 33:47-48 - Deuteronomy 32:48-52 - 34:1-5) when the ark of the covenant of God had not yet entered the territory of the Canaanites neither by the river Jordan nor by the mountains (Numbers 14:40-45 - Joshua 3:1-4), it is specified that if the people are obedient to God then they will add three more cities of refuge to accommodate innocent murderers (Deuteronomy 19:1-10). [The logic remains unchanged in the improbable hypothesis where Numbers 35:1-8 would have been stated after Deuteronomy 19:1-10]
40 But the exact identity of the holy spirit could not be known while the hereditary tribe of Levi remained, since these children of Jacob were the only ones authorized to serve in the house of Yahweh (Numbers 3:14-16,39-41,42-51 - 8:22-26 - Deuteronomy 10:5-9 - 18:1-8 - Nehemiah 8:6-12). 
41 For if God owns a house, then who is authorized to perform a function in it and what is the particular service that is rendered to God (Deuteronomy 12:1-12,13-14 - 14:22-27,28-29). 
42 Even during a time when they actually have livestock available in the wilderness, continuous morning and evening burnt offerings (Exodus 29:38-42,43-46) cannot be made until the tabernacle is installed (Acts 7:38-45). For this tabernacle is dismantled and carried whenever the congregation moves (Exodus 40:36-38 - Numbers 4:1-33,49 - 9:15-23 - Deuteronomy 1:32-33 - Numbers 33:1-49). 
43 And in accordance with the words of the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 66:1-2) spoken long before Ezekiel (Isaiah 1:1 - Ezekiel 1:1-3) and after David who is the second king of Israel, Jesus of Nazareth revealed that the house of God is the body of the human being (and even living beings).
44 One gets the impression that the book Song of songs of Solomon gives importance to physical appearances (Song of songs 4 - 5) but this is only to serve as a comparison (John 3:26-29,30-36 - 2 Corinthians 11:1-3 - Luke 13:18-21 - Ezekiel 16:1-43), since the desires of the flesh are used to describe the quality of the relationship between God or more precisely the Son of God on the one hand (since it is obvious that the bridegroom described is not Solomon - Song of songs 1:1 - 8:11-12), and on the other hand each of his disciples who is for him a bride (John 13:33-35 - 14:15 - Psalms 119:1-37,67-77,135-142).
45 We are currently on the sixth day of creation. And the holy sabbath of God is Jesus Christ, for the one who attaches oneself only to the spirit has no need of any other initiative and must simply bear in patience and humility one's own ancient sins and those of one's genealogy (Exodus 34:5-7 - 1 Peter 5:6-9 - 2 Corinthians 11:23-33 - Acts 22:1-21,22-24). 
46 Now I do not know which biblical writings influenced the early Christian apologist and philosopher Justin Martyr the most, but I note that his teaching is that of a person who could have had a great confidence in the thirteen epistles of the apostle Paul and the two epistles of Peter, and who knew that Jesus Christ did not impose the creation of structures whose sole purpose is to worship him, but who did not succeed in identifying the exact definition of eternal life (1 Rommel 3:2). It is said that Justin Martyr was born less than seventy years after the death of Jesus Christ, and Justin teaches as a person who knows that Jesus Christ has existed, and has put an end to the various laws given by Moses to the children of Jacob, and has revealed the purpose of life. For Justin has said the following things which I think I did not alter the meaning.
47 # The new law requires a perpetual sabbath. As for you, you think that you are godly because you idle for one day each week, without understanding why these things had been commanded to you. (Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, chapter 12) # Moreover, all those righteous men already mentioned [that is to say, Enoch, Noah, Melchizedek, Abraham], though they kept no sabbaths, were pleasing to God. And after them Abraham with all his descendants until Moses, under whom your nation appeared unrighteous and ungrateful to God, making a calf in the wilderness. This is why, accommodating himself to that nation, God enjoined them also to offer sacrifices, as if to his name, in order that you might not serve idols. However you have not observed those precepts, and you have sacrificed your children to demons. And you were commanded to keep sabbaths in order to retain the memorial of God, since his word makes this announcement by saying in Ezekiel 20:12, 'So that you may know that I am God who sanctifies you'. (Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, chapter 19) # For you are not distinguished in any other way than by the fleshly circumcision, as I remarked previously. For Abraham was declared by God to be righteous, not on account of circumcision, but on account of faith. For before he was circumcised the following statement was made regarding him, 'Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness', Genesis 15:6. And we, therefore, in the uncircumcision of our flesh, believing God through Christ, and having that circumcision which is of advantage to us who have acquired it — namely, that of the heart — we hope to appear righteous before and well-pleasing to God, since already we have received His testimony through the words of the prophets. And, further, God will be slandered unless you acknowledge that you were commanded to observe the Sabbath, and to present offerings, and that the Lord submitted to have a place called by the name of God, in order that, as has been said, you might not become impious and godless by worshipping idols and forgetting God, as indeed you do always appear to have been. Now, that God enjoined the ordinances of Sabbaths and offerings for these reasons, I have proved in what I previously remarked. But for the sake of those who came today, I wish to repeat nearly the whole. (Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, chapter 92)
48 # But since sensation remains for all who have ever lived, and eternal punishment is reserved (that is, for the wicked), see that you do not neglect to be convinced and believe that these things are true. For let even necromancy, and the divinations which you practice by immaculate children, and the evocation of departed human souls, and those who are called among the magi, dream senders and assistant spirits (familiars), and all that is done by those who are skilled in such matters, let these things persuade you that even after death souls are in a state of sensation... We expect to receive again our own bodies, though they be dead and cast into the earth, for we maintain that with God nothing is impossible. (The First Apology, chapter 18) # But lest some should, without reason, and for the perversion of what we teach, maintain that we say that Christ was born one hundred and fifty years ago under Cyrenius, and subsequently, in the time of Pontius Pilate, taught what we say he taught. And lest they cry out against us as though all men who were born before him were irresponsible. Let us anticipate and solve the difficulty. We have been taught that Christ is the firstborn of God, and we have declared above that he is the Word of whom every kind of men were partakers. And those who lived reasonably are Christians, even though they have been thought atheists, like Socrates and Heraclitus among the Greeks, and men like them. (The First Apology, chapter 46) # For I myself, when I discovered the wicked disguise which the evil spirits had thrown around the divine doctrines of the Christians, to turn aside others from joining them, I laughed both at those who framed these falsehoods, and at the disguise itself, and at popular opinion, and I confess that I both boast and with all my strength strive to be found a Christian. Not because the teachings of Plato are different from those of Christ, but because they are not in all respects similar, as neither are those of the others, Stoics, and poets, and historians. For each man spoke well in proportion to the share that he had of the spermatic word, seeing what was related to it. But they who contradict themselves on the more important points appear not to have possessed the heavenly wisdom, and the knowledge which cannot be spoken against. Whatever things were rightly said among all men, are the property of us Christians. For next to God, we worship and love the Word who is from the unbegotten and ineffable God. (The Second Apology, chapter 13)
49 # Hence we are called atheists. And we confess that we are atheists, so far as gods of this sort are concerned, but not with respect to the most true God, the Father of righteousness and temperance and the other virtues, who is free from all impurity. But both him, and the Son (who came forth from him and taught us these things, and the host of the other good angels who follow and are made like to him), and the prophetic Spirit, we worship and adore, knowing them in reason and truth, and declaring without grudging to every one who wishes to learn, as we have been taught. (The First Apology, chapter 6) # Our doctrines, then, appear to be greater than all human teaching. Because Christ, who appeared for our sakes, became the whole rational being, both body, and reason, and soul. For whatever either lawgivers or philosophers uttered well, they elaborated by finding and contemplating some part of the Word. But since they did not know the whole of the Word, which is Christ, they often contradicted themselves. And those who by human birth were more ancient than Christ, when they attempted to consider and prove things by reason, were brought before the tribunals as impious persons and busybodies [Now a busybody is a body that is inhabited by evil spirits]. And Socrates, who was more zealous in this direction than all of them, was accused of the very same crimes as ourselves. For they said that he was introducing new divinities, and did not consider those to be gods whom the state recognized. But he cast out from the state both Homer and the rest of the poets, and taught men to reject the wicked demons and those who did the things which the poets related. And he exhorted them to become acquainted with the God who was to them unknown, by means of the investigation of reason. And he said, 'It is not easy to find the Father and Maker of all things, and it is not safe to declare him to all after having found him'. But our Christ has done these things through his own power. For no one trusted in Socrates so as to die for this doctrine, in spite of the fact that Christ was partially known even by Socrates since Christ was and is the Word who is in every man, and who foretold the things that were to come to pass, and who foretold it both through the prophets and by his own person when he was teaching while being animated by the same passions. But concerning Christ, not only philosophers and scholars believed, but also artisans and people entirely uneducated, despising both glory, and fear, and death. For he is a power of the ineffable Father, not the mere instrument of human reason. (The Second Apology, chapter 10)
50 What sober-minded man, then, will not acknowledge that we are not atheists, worshiping as we do the Maker of this universe, and declaring, as we have been taught, that he has no need of streams of blood and libations and incense. We praise him to the utmost of our power by the exercise of prayer and thanksgiving for all things wherewith we are supplied, as we have been taught that the only honor that is worthy of him is not to consume by fire what he has brought into being for our sustenance, but to use it for ourselves and for those who are in need, and to do it with gratitude to him, by offering thanks with invocations and hymns for our creation, and for all the means of health, and for the various qualities of the different kinds of things, and for the changes of the seasons. And to present supplications before him in order to live in incorruption through faith in him. Our teacher of these things is Jesus Christ, who also was born for this purpose, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea, in the times of Tiberius Caesar. And we reasonably worship him, having learned that he is the Son of the true God himself, and holding him in the second place, and the prophetic Spirit in the third place, as we will prove. For they proclaim our madness to consist in this, that we give to a crucified man a place second to the unchangeable and eternal God, the creator of all things. It is because they do not discern the mystery that is herein, to which, as we make it plain to you, we pray you to give heed. (The First Apology, Chapter 13)
51 # Trypho: Be assured that all our nation waits for Christ, and we admit that all the Scriptures which you have quoted refer to Him. Moreover, I do also admit that the name of Jesus, by which the the son of Nave (Nun) was called, has inclined me very strongly to adopt this view. But whether Christ should be so shamefully crucified, this we are in doubt about. For whosoever is crucified is said in the law to be accursed, so that I am exceedingly incredulous on this point. It is quite clear, indeed, that the Scriptures announce that Christ had to suffer. But we wish to learn if you can prove it to us whether it was by the suffering cursed in the law. (Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, chapter 89) # Trypho: Those who affirm him to have been a man, and to have been anointed by election, and then to have become Christ, appear to me to speak more plausibly than you who hold those opinions which you express. For we all expect that Christ will be a man born of men, and that Elijah when he comes will anoint him. But if this man appear to be Christ, he must certainly be known as man born of men. But from the circumstance that Elijah has not yet come, I infer that this man is not He [the Christ]... Trypho: This statement also seems to me paradoxical, namely the fact that the prophetic Spirit of God, who was in Elijah, was also in John... Justin: Do you not think that the same thing happened in the case of Joshua the son of Nun, who succeeded to the command of the people after Moses, when Moses was commanded to lay his hands on Joshua, and God said to him, 'I will take of the spirit which is in you, and put it on him'... Trypho: Certainly... Justin: As therefore, while Moses was still among men, God took of the spirit which was in Moses and put it on Joshua, even so God was able to cause the spirit of Elijah to come on John. And therefore, as Christ at his first coming appeared inglorious, even so the first coming of the spirit, which remained always pure in Elijah like that of Christ, might be perceived to be inglorious. (Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, chapter 19 - Numbers 27:15-17,18-20,21-23 - Deuteronomy 34:7-9)  
52 Now I have a different interpretation regarding the connection between John the Baptist and Elijah (4 Rommel 2:62-65 - 14:12), and I specify the only purpose of prayer (4 Rommel 6:36). And regarding water baptism (4 Rommel 6:39-43), I assert that it is impossible that the authors of the epistles of Paul and Peter and John have declared that the name of the creator was too holy to be uttered since their only message is that it is enough to know Jesus to know God. However, because of the nuances contained in the writings of these apostles, it is possible that the one who wrote the content of the five previous verses also wrote the following things about water baptism, but this is difficult to understand and what is intriguing is that he does not specify how a person obtains the right to baptize others. 
53 I will also relate the manner in which we dedicated ourselves to God when we had been made new through Christ. Lest, if we omit this, we seem to be unfair in the explanation we are making. As many as are persuaded and believe that what we teach and say is true, and undertake to be able to live accordingly, are instructed to pray and to entreat God with fasting, for the remission of their sins that are past, we praying and fasting with them. Then they are brought by us where there is water, and are regenerated in the same manner in which we were ourselves regenerated. For, in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, they then receive the washing with water. For Christ also said, 'Except you are born again, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven'. Now, that it is impossible for those who have once been born to enter into the wombs of their mothers, is manifest to all. And how those who have sinned and repent will escape their sins, is declared by Isaiah the prophet, as I wrote above. He thus speaks: 'Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from your souls, learn to do well, judge the fatherless, and plead for the widow. And come and let us reason together, says the Lord. And though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white like wool. And though they be as crimson, I will make them white as snow. But if you refuse and rebel, then the sword will devour you. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken it'. And for this [rite] we have learned from the apostles the following reason. At our birth we were born without our own knowledge or choice, by our parents coming together, and were brought up in bad habits and wicked training. So the rite is done so that we may not remain the children of necessity and of ignorance, but may become the children of choice and knowledge, and may obtain in the water the remission of sins formerly committed. Therefore the first thing that is pronounced over him who chooses to be born again and has repented of his sins, is the name of God the Father and Lord of the universe. For he who leads to the laver the person that is to be washed calls him by this name alone. For no one can utter the name of the ineffable God, and if any one dare to say that there is a name then he raves with a hopeless madness. And this washing is called illumination, because they who learn these things are illuminated in their understandings. And the second thing that is pronounced is the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate. And the third thing that is pronounced is  the name of the Holy Spirit who through the prophets foretold all things about Jesus. And then he who is illuminated is washed. (The First Apology, Chapter 61) ... Old Man: But I do not say, indeed, that all souls die. For that were truly a piece of good fortune to the evil. What then? The souls of the pious remain in a better place, while those of the unjust and wicked are in a worse, waiting for the time of judgment. Thus some which have appeared worthy of God never die, but others are punished so long as God wills them to exist and to be punished... Justin: Is what you say, then, of a like nature with that which Plato in Timaeus hints about the world, when he says that it is indeed subject to decay, inasmuch as it has been created, but that it will neither be dissolved nor meet with the fate of death on account of the will of God? Does it seem to you the very same can be said of the soul, and generally of all things? For those things which exist after God, or will at any time exist, these have the nature of decay, and are such as may be blotted out and cease to exist. For God alone is unbegotten and incorruptible, and therefore He is God, but all other things after Him are created and corruptible. For this reason souls both die and are punished. Since, if they were unbegotten, they would neither sin, nor be filled with folly, nor be cowardly, and again ferocious. Neither would they willingly transform into swine, and serpents, and dogs, and it would not indeed be just to compel them, if they be unbegotten. For that which is unbegotten is similar to, equal to, and the same with that which is unbegotten; and neither in power nor in honor should the one be preferred to the other, and hence there are not many things which are unbegotten. For if there were some difference between them, you would not discover the cause of the difference, though you searched for it. But after letting the mind ever wander to infinity, you would at length, wearied out, take your stand on one Unbegotten, and say that this is the Cause of all. Did such escape the observation of Plato and Pythagoras, those wise men who have been as a wall and fortress of philosophy to us? (Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, chapter 5).
54 Now Justin Martyr has clearly indicated several times in the excerpts not concerning water baptism that he was saying things as they had been taught to them. So I think there are relevant things that we do not have in the form of writings from their authors but that had been said and taught either by the apostles (Acts 20:17-21 - 28:16-31), or by the disciples of the apostles (2 Timothy 2:1-7), or by other persons who had a better knowledge of the events of the life of Jesus Christ. And I think that among those relevant statements whose true authors we do not know is the introduction to the Epistle to the Hebrews, an epistle which contains many lies (4 Rommel 2:24-25 - 5 Rommel 9:5-18) but where the following thing is said: After having spoken in the past to our fathers through the prophets at various times and in various ways. God has spoken to us in these last days through his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things and by whom he also made the worlds. And the Son, being the brightness of the glory of the God and the very image of the substance of God, and upholding all things by his mighty word, has made the purification of sins and has gone to sit down at the right hand of the Majesty in the highest places. For he is so much better than angels that he has obtained a name that is more excellent than theirs (Hebrews 1:1-4).
55 Indeed, some authors may draw inspiration from knowledge that was proclaimed before them and whose full meaning they do not necessarily understand. This is what Justin Martyr thinks of the Greek philosopher Plato since he wrote the following thing.
56 And the physiological discussion concerning the Son of God in the Timaeus of Plato, where he says, 'He placed him crosswise in the universe', he borrowed in like manner from Moses. For in the writings of Moses it is related how at that time, when the Israelites went out of Egypt and were in the wilderness, they fell in with poisonous beasts, both vipers and asps, and every kind of serpent, which slew the people. And that Moses, by the inspiration and influence of God, took brass, and made it into the figure of a cross, and set it in the holy tabernacle, and said to the people, 'If you look to this figure, and believe, you will be saved thereby'. And when this was done, it is recorded that the serpents died, and it is handed down that the people thus escaped death. Which things Plato reading, and not accurately understanding, and not apprehending that it was the figure of the cross, but taking it to be a placing crosswise, he said that the power next to the first God was placed crosswise in the universe. And as to his speaking of a third, he did this because he read, as we said above, that which was spoken by Moses, 'that the Spirit of God moved over the waters'. For he gives the second place to the Logos which is with God, who he said was placed crosswise in the universe. And the third place to the Spirit who was said to be borne on the water, saying, 'And the third around the third'. And hear how the Spirit of prophecy signified through Moses that there should be a conflagration. He spoke thus: 'Everlasting fire will descend, and will devour to the pit beneath'. It is not, then, that we hold the same opinions as others, but that all speak in imitation of ours. Among us these things can be heard and learned from persons who do not even know the forms of the letters, who are uneducated and barbarous in speech, though wise and believing in mind. Some, indeed, even are maimed and deprived of eyesight, so that you may understand that these things are not the effect of human wisdom, but are uttered by the power of God. (The First Apology, Chapter 60 - 4 Rommel 6:24)
57 And the holy Spirit of prophecy taught us this, telling us by Moses that God spoke thus to the man first created: 'Behold, before thy face are good and evil: choose the good'. And again, by the other prophet Isaiah, that the following utterance was made as if from God the Father and Lord of all, 'Wash you, make you clean. Put away evils from your souls, learn to do well, judge the orphan, and plead for the widow. And come and let us reason together, says the Lord. If your sins are like scarlet, then I will make them white as wool. And if they are red like as crimson, then I will make them white as snow. For if you are willing and obey me, then you will eat the good of the land. But if you do not obey me, then the sword will devour you. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken it'. And that expression, 'The sword will devour you', does not mean that the disobedient will be kill by the sword, but the sword of God is a fire of which those who choose to act wickedly become the fuel. Therefore he says, 'The sword will devour you, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it'. And if He had spoken concerning a sword that cuts and at once despatches, He would not have said, will devour. And so, too, Plato, when he says, 'The blame is his who chooses, and God is blameless', took this from the prophet Moses and uttered it. For Moses is more ancient than all the Greek writers. And whatever both philosophers and poets have said concerning the immortality of the soul, or punishments after death, or contemplation of heavenly things, or doctrines of the like kind, they have received such suggestions from the prophets as have enabled them to understand and interpret these things. And hence there seem to be seeds of truth among all men, but they are charged with not accurately understanding [the truth] when they assert contradictories. (The First Apology, Chapter 44)
