1 A psalm of David, when he was in the cave. I cry to Yahweh with my voice, I implore Yahweh with my voice. 
2 I pour out my complaint before him, I declared my distress in his presence. 
3 My spirit is crushed within me, but you know my path. And they have hidden a snare for me in the way where I walk. 
4 I look at my right hand, and I do not see someone there who knows me. There is no refuge where I can relax, and there is no one to save me. 
5 O Yahweh, I cry to you and say: You are my hope, my portion in the land of the living. 
6 Listen to my cry, for I am very distressed. Free me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me. 
7 Bring my soul out of its prison, so that I may still have the opportunity to praise your name. The righteous will surround me and learn from me, when you will have done me good.
