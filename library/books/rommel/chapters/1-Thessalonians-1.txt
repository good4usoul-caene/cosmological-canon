1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you. 
2 We always thank God for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers. 
3 Constantly recalling before our God and Father the work of your faith, the work of your love and the firmness of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. 
4 For we know, beloved brothers, that you have been chosen by God. 
5 For our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with the power of the Holy Spirit for a deep conviction. And you know how we lived among you for your sake [that is to say, to give you an example]. 
6 And you yourselves became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction but with the joy given by the Holy Spirit. 
7 And you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 
8 For the word of the Lord has spread from you in Macedonia and Achaia. In fact, your faith in God has become known everywhere, so we did not have to inform anyone about it. 
9 For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception that we had among you, and how you abandoned idols to turn to God, to serve the living and true God.
10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, namely Jesus who rescues us from the wrath to come.
