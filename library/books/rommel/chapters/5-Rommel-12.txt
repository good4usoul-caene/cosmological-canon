1 Comments on the epistles of the apostles and the gospels, second part: Figures of rhetoric, Prayer.
2 In each book of the new testament, different verses do not have the meaning that suits them when considered in isolation. And it is essential to be interested in the harmony of all the writings of the same author, at least the same book, before extracting a true message. 
3 Subdividing the scriptures into different verses is therefore a practical idea for making quotations, but can become a trap if it is not used conscientiously. 
4 Because of this, the introduction of some falsified verses into one of these books may be enough to distract the reader from the path to follow, and even suggest to people who have the common sense notion inscribed in their hearts that the scriptures cannot be holy.
5 The prayer of the believer is good and necessary, but its only usefulness, and in no way a negligible cause, is to strengthen the faith of the one who prays. 
6 It is to strengthen the one who prays. For the scriptures tell us that everything is written in advance (Isaiah 43:5-7). 
7 And if anyone understands through his faith in the scriptures that everything is written in advance, then all he has left to do is to have faith possibly accompanied by hymns and praises for the creator (1 Timothy 1:5). 
8 And Peter defines faith only by its characteristics (2 Peter 1:5-8). 
9 It seems unlikely to me that a non-believer can understand that everything is written in advance (Luke 18:17).
10 About the prayer in Luke's gospel.
11 Luke informs us that the only purpose of prayer is to give the believer the strength not to transgress the only commandment that constitutes faith (Luke 22:40 - 21:34-36 - 11:1-4). 
12 In addition, we know that some believers will suffer because of their faith, and some will lose the life of their carnal envelopes because of that same faith (Luke 21:16-19). 
13 Now it is evident that he who has had faith by the knowledge of the scriptures cannot hope that the promises do not happen, because he expects the next life which is also a promise.
14 Therefore, with regard to what we can honestly ask in our prayers we must think that it is only about the holy spirit (Luke 11:13).
15 Moreover, since the holy spirit is in the world, the time of the prophets who approached God by prayer is past (Luke 16:16).
16 About the prayer in John's gospel.
17 We know that we should not trust a man (Jeremiah 17:5). As a result, the man Jesus speaks of himself only as the only begotten son of God when he says we will be listened to if we ask anything in his name (John 14:14-15 - 16:23-24). 
18 Because we cannot wish him to become a liar, the utility of prayer becomes clear to us when we understand that we cannot ask, in the name of the only begotten Son of God, that they do not occur in our lives the events that he himself has foretold (John 16:1-4).
19 About the prayer in the first epistle of John.
20 John confirms to us that not all have eternal life (4 Rommel 4:3-4), as it has already been established by God, and he recommends us to pray for God to give life (4 Rommel 11:23) to every person (1 John 2:19 - 5:14-17). 
21 We then understand that the goal is to help the believer not to hate those who have not yet understood, in other words not to compromise oneself in the faith because it is not the actions of others that must determine our state before God. Let us not forget the purpose of life.
22 One might ask, however, why the only prayer that is forbidden is to ask God to have compassion for a person who has abandoned the faith (Luke 12:10 - 2 Peter 2:20-21), assuming that this person has already truly known the faith.
23 The answer is that it could destroy our own faith if we imagined that it is possible for us to extinguish for a short time the spirit of God who is in us, with the intention of rekindling it later. 
24 Adultery to God is indeed unforgivable (Acts 5:1-6,7-11 - 1 Samuel 2:25).
25 About the prayer in Peter's letters.
26 Peter states that faith has priority over prayer (1 Peter 4:7-8).
27 About prayer in Paul's letters.
28 As I explained in the section 'The Humor of the Scriptures', Paul generally speaks indirectly, having himself repeatedly stated that he is speaking primarily to the Gentiles, although God make no distinction between men since his only begotten Son is seated at his right according to the gospel which was entrusted to Paul (1 Peter 1:17 - Colossians 3:24-25 - 1 Timothy 1:11 - Galatians 2:7-8). 
29 Knowing that he cannot contradict the other apostles and gospels, it can be seen that this is indeed the case (Ephesians 6:18 - Romans 8:26-27).
