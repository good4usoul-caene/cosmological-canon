1 Praise Yahweh. Sing a new song to Yahweh. Let his praise be heard in the assembly of the saints. 
2 Let Israel rejoice in the one who made him. Let the children of Zion rejoice in their king. 
3 Let them praise his name with the flute. Let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp. 
4 For Yahweh takes pleasure in those who love him, he will glorify the powerless with salvation. 
5 Let the saints be joyful because of their glory. Let them breathe out with joy on their beds. 
6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two edged sword in their hand. 
7 To execute vengeance on the nations, and to punish the peoples. 
8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron. 
9 To execute the judgment that is written against them. This honor belongs to all his saints. Praise Yahweh.
