1 Out of the depths I call on you, O Yahweh. 
2 Hear my voice, O Lord. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
3 If you wanted to remember our iniquities continually [without any mercy when we repent by following the procedure indicated in your law], then who could stand before you. 
4 But mercy is with you, so that we may learn to fear you. 
5 I wait for Yahweh. My soul waits, and my hope is in his word. 
6 My soul is waiting for the Lord more than those who watch for the morning. Yes, more than those who watch for the morning. 
7 Put your hope in Yahweh, O Israel. For there is mercy with Yahweh, there is a great redemption with our Lord. 
8 He will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
