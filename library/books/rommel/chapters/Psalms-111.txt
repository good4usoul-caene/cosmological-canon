1 Praise Yahweh. I will praise Yahweh with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation. 
2 The works of Yahweh [the holy spirit of Elohim] are great, and are sought out by all those who have pleasure in them. 
3 His work is honor and majesty, and his righteousness endures forever. 
4 He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered in all generations. Yahweh is merciful and gracious. 
5 He has given a portion [namely a legacy] to those who fear him, for he continuously remembers his covenant. 
6 He has made known to his people the power of his works, when he has given them the inheritance of the nations [namely their land]. 
7 The works of his hands are truth and justice. All his precepts are relevant. 
8 They are established forever and ever [for their teaching is useful in all generations], and they are done in faithfulness and uprightness. 
9 He has sent salvation to his people, he has established his covenant forever. His name is holy and awesome. 
10 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. Everyone who learns from his commandments has a good understanding, for the glory of Yahweh endures forever.
