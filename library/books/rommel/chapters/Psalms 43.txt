1 Judge me, O God, and defend my cause against ungodly people. Protect me against the deceitful and unjust man. 
2 For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me. Why must I walk in the sorrow caused by the oppression of the enemy. 
3 Send your light and your faithfulness, and let them guide me. Let them bring me to your holy mountain and to your dwelling places. 
4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to the God of my joy and my happiness. And I will sing praises to you on the harp, O God, my God.
5 Why is my soul cast down now. Why is it groaning within me. But I wait for God, and I will always praise him because he is my helper and my God.
