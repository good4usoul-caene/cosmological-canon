1 Why this tumult among the nations. Why do the people imagine vain things. 
2 The kings of the earth rise up, and the rulers of the peoples conspire with them against Yahweh and against his anointed. 
3 And they said: Let us break their bonds, and free ourselves from their chains. 
4 But he who rules in the heavens laughs at them. The Lord will have them in derision. 
5 And he will speak to them in his anger, and he will trouble them in his deep displeasure. 
6 It is I who have set my king on my holy mountain, on Zion. 
7 I will declare the decree. Yahweh has said to me: You are my son, I have begotten you today. 
8 Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for an inheritance, and the ends of the earth for a possession. 
9 You will break them with a scepter of iron, and break them into pieces like a pottery. 
10 Therefore be wise now, you the kings. Receive instruction, you the judges of the earth. 
11 Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 
12 Kiss the son, lest he be angry. For you will perish in the way when his anger will suddenly be kindled. Blessed are all those who will believe in his message. [For you will have no other gods before me]
