1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses in the following words. 
2 Speak to the children of Israel, and take from them a rod in each of the house of their fathers. It will be twelve rods from all their princes according to the houses of their fathers. And you will write each man's name on his rod. 
3 And you will write the name of Aaron on the rod of Levi, for there will be a rod for every chief of their fathers' houses. 
4 And you will place them in the tent of meeting, in front of the ark of the testimony where I meet with you. 
5 And the man whom I choose will be the one whose rod will flourish, and I will thus put an end to the murmurings of the children of Israel against you. 
6 Then Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and all their princes gave him a rod, each prince a rod, according to the houses of their fathers. There were twelve rods, and Aaron’s rod was in their midst. 
7 And Moses laid the rods before Yahweh in the tent of meeting. 
8 And the next day when Moses entered the tent of meeting, behold the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded. It had sprouted buds, and had produced blossoms and bare ripe almonds. 
9 And Moses took away all the rods before Yahweh and brought them to all the children of Israel. And they looked at them, and each took his rod. 
10 And Yahweh said to Moses, Bring back Aaron's rod before the testimony, to be kept as a sign to the children of rebellion. And so you will put an end to their murmurs before me so that they do not die. 
11 And Moses did as Yahweh commanded him. He did so. 
12 And the children of Israel spoke to Moses by saying, Behold we die, we perish, we are all lost. 
13 He who comes near to Yahweh or who comes near to his tabernacle, the same one dies. Must we all be consumed and die.
