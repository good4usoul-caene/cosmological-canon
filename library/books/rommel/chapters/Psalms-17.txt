1 The prayer of David. Hear what is right, O Yahweh, consider my cry. Listen to my prayer made with lips without deceit. 
2 Let my righteousness appear before your face, let your eyes look at the fairness of my deeds. 
3 If you visit my heart in the night and probe it, if you test me, then you will find nothing. For what comes out of my mouth comes from the righteousness of my thoughts. 
4 I guard myself against the way of wicked men. I do not let myself be influenced by the works of men, in accordance with the word of your lips.
5 Sustain my steps in your paths, so that my feet may not slip. 
6 I have called on you. Surely you will hear me, O God. Incline your ear to me, and hear my words. 
7 Show your marvellous lovingkindness, you who save by your right hand those who trust in you from those who rise against them. 
8 Keep me as the apple of your eye. Hide me in the shadow of your wings. 
9 Keep me from the wicked who oppress me, from my deadly enemies who surround me. 
10 They are inclosed in their own fat, they have haughty words in their mouths. 
11 They have surrounded us in our steps, they are watching us to overthrow us. 
12 Like a lion eager to tear, a young lion lurking in secret places. 
13 Arise and disappoint him, O Yahweh. Overthrow him. Save my soul from the wicked with your sword. 
14 Save me from men by your hand, O Yahweh, from the men of the world who have their portion is in this life. You fill their belly with your store. Their children are satisfied, and leave the residue of their substance to their babes [because you often wait to perform your judgments]. 
15 As for me, I will see your face in my innocence. I will be satisfied with your image when I awake.
