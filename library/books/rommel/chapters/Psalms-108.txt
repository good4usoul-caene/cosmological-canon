1 A psalm of David. My heart is prepared, O God. I will sing and praise you, it is my glory. 
2 Awake, my lute and my harp. I will awake the morning. 
3 I will praise you among the peoples, O Yahweh. I will sing to you among the nations. 
4 For your mercy is high above the clouds, and your faithfulness reaches to the heavens. 
5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God, and let your glory be on all the earth. 
6 In order to free your beloveds from the hand of the enemy. Answer us, save us with your right hand. 
7 God has spoken in his holiness and has said: I will triumph, I will divide Shechem and measure the valley of Succoth. 
8 Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine. Ephraim is my helmet, and Judah is my lawgiver. 
9 Moab is my washbasin, and I cast my shoe on Edom. I will shout for joy over the land of the Philistines. 
10 Now therefore, will you not bring me into the fortified city. Will you not lead me to Edom. 
11 Will you reject us again, O God. Will you not go with us in the midst of our armies, O God. 
12 It is in you that we will seek help in distress, for it is fruitless to seek only the help of men. 
13 We will do valiantly through God, for it is he who will tread down our enemies.
