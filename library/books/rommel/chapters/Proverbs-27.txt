1 Do not boast of tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth. 
2 Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth. A stranger, and not your own lips. 
3 There are heavy stones and weighty quantities of sand, but the wrath of a fool is heavier than both. 
4 Wrath is cruel and anger is impetuous, but who can stand before jealousy. 
5 Open rebuke is better than hidden love. 
6 A friend may speak harsh words because of his faithfulness, and an enemy may kiss you deceitfully.
7 He who is full is disgusted by a honeycomb, but even a bitter thing is sweet to the hungry soul. 
8 As a bird that wanders from its nest, so is a man who wanders from his home. 
9 As ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, so the heartfelt counsel of a friend is sweet.

12 A prudent man hides himself when he sees the evil, but the simple-minded continues and may suffer for it. 
13 Take his garment, for he has made himself a surety for a stranger. Exact from him a pledge, because of the stranger. 
14 If a man blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, then it is not sincere and he actually desires his neighbor's misfortune. 
15 A contentious woman is like a continuous fall of water on a rainy day. 
16 He who would restrain her will restrain the wind, and his right hand will encounter oil. 
17 As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.

20 As the grave and destruction are never satisfied, so a man's eyes are never satisfied. 
21 As the refining pot is used to purify silver, and as the furnace is used to purify gold, so a man's reputation searches his heart. 
22 If you were to crush a fool in a mortar, among the grains with a pestle, his folly would not depart from him.
