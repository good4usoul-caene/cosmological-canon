1 O Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction. 
2 He swore to Yahweh, he made the following vow to the mighty one of Jacob. 
3 I will not enter the dwelling where I live, I will not go up on my bed. 
4 I will not give sleep to my eyes, I will not give rest to my eyelids. 
5 Until I find out a place for Yahweh, a house for the mighty one of Jacob. 
6 We heard of it in Ephrathah. We found the ark of the covenant in the fields of Kiriath-jearim. 
7 We will go to the house of our God, and we will bow down before his footstool. 
8 Get up, O Yahweh. Come to your place of rest, you and the ark of your majesty. 
9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your saints rejoice.
10 Do not hold back your anointed one, for the sake of David your servant [to whom you promised to establish his legacy forever]. 
11 For Yahweh has sworn the truth to David, and he will not turn away from it: I will put on your throne a fruit of your intestines [that is to say your true spiritual son, for his love for me will be very similar to your love for me]. 
12 If your sons [according to the flesh] perform my covenant and my testimonies that will be taught to them, then their sons also will always sit on your throne. 
13 For Yahweh has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling [that is to say, he has desired to put his name there]. 
14 It is my place of rest forever [for the ark of my covenant and my altar of offerings will no longer be moved to be used elsewhere as was the case before]. I will live there because I have desired it. 
15 I will bless the food of the city, and even its poor will be satisfied with bread. 
16 I will clothe its priests with salvation, and its saints will rejoice greatly [in their end]. 
17 It is there that I will cause the horn of David to sprout. For I will set there a lamp for my anointed. 
18 I will shame his enemies, and his crown will shine on him.
