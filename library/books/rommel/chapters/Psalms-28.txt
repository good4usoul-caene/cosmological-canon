1 A psalm of David. I cry to you, O Yahweh. Do not be deaf to me, you who are my strength, lest I become like those who go down to the pit when you stop taking care of me. 
2 Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you, when I lift up my hands toward your holy oracle [the most holy place of your sanctuary]. 
3 Do not carry me away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity, all those who speak peace to their neighbors while malice is in their hearts [the desires of their hearts cannot be justified]. 
4 Reward them according to their deeds, according to the wickedness of their endeavours. Repay them according to the work of their hands, give them what they deserve. 
5 For they have not considered the works of Yahweh, the testimonies of how his hand has behaved toward his people. Therefore you will not raise them up, but you will overthrow them. 
6 Blessed be Yahweh, for he has heard the voice of my supplications. 
7 Yahweh is my strength and my shield. My heart has trusted in him, and he helped me. Therefore my heart rejoices, and I praise him with my song. 
8 Yahweh is the strength of his people, he is the strength of the salvation of his anointed. 
9 Save your people and bless your inheritance. Be their shepherd, and exalt them forever.
