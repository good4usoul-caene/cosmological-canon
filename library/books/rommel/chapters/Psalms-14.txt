1 A psalm of David. The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God'. They have become corrupt, they have committed abominations, there is none who does good.
2 Yahweh looks down on the children of men from heaven, to see if there is anyone who understands and seeks God. [Evil is that which is intentional and unjustifiable in the eyes of any assembly of saints, and such an assembly knows that each one acts according to his particular knowledge and circumstances] 
3 They have all gone out of the way, they have all become corrupt. There is none who does good. No, not even one. 
4 Have all the workers of iniquity lost their minds. They eat my people as they eat bread, they do not call on Yahweh. 
5 But they will be taken by fear, because God is with the righteous in all generations. 
6 You mock the hope of the powerless, but Yahweh is his refuge. 
7 Oh give salvation to Israel out of Zion. When Yahweh turns the captivity of his people, then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad.
