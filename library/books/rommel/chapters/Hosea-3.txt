1 Then Yahweh said to me: Go again, and love another woman who is loved by her friend and who is an adulteress. It is according to the love of Yahweh toward the children of Israel, since they turn to other gods and love the cakes of raisin. 
2 So I bought her for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and half of a homer of barley. 
3 And I said to her: Stay with me for several days. You will not play the whore, and you will not belong to any other person, and I will be thus toward you. [That is to say, we will both be together but we will not make love together, and neither of us will make love with anyone else.] 
4 For the children of Israel will remain many days without a king, and without a prince, and without making sacrifices, and without an image [that is to say, a false god set up in public places], and without the ephod, and without the teraphim [that is to say, household gods]. 
5 Afterward the children of Israel will return and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king. And they will rejoice in the fear of Yahweh and in his goodness, in the latter days.
