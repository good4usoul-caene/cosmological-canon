1 A psalm of the sons of Korah. God is our refuge and our strength, a help that is always present in trouble. 
2 Therefore we will not fear, even if the earth quakes and the mountains collapse.
3 Even if the waters of the sea are agitated and roar, and the mountains tremble because of its waves. Pause. 
4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High. 
5 God is in the city, therefore it will not be moved. God helps it from the morning dawn. 
6 Nations raged and kingdoms were moved, but God uttered his voice and the earth melted. 
7 Yahweh the God of armies is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Pause. 
8 Come and see the works of Yahweh, the wonders that he has done on the earth. 
9 He has caused wars to cease to the ends of the earth. He has broken the bow and has shattered the spear, and he has burned the chariots with fire. 
10 Calm down and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted throughout the earth. 
11 Yahweh the God of armies is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Pause.
