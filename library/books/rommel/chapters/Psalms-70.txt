1 A psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. Make haste to rescue me, O God. Make haste to help me, O Yahweh. 
2 Let them be bewildered and ashamed, those who seek my soul. Let them turn back and be disappointed, all those who desire my destruction. 
3 Let them turn back because of their shame, all those who say: Aha, aha. 
4 And let all those who seek you be glad and rejoice in you. Let those who love your salvation say continuously: Praise God. 
5 As for me, I am powerless and needy. Make haste to come to me, O God, for you are my helper and my savior. Do not delay, O Yahweh.
