1 A psalm of David. Blessed be Yahweh my strength, the one who teaches my hands to fight, my fingers to battle. 
2 He is my benefactor and my fortress, my high tower and my savior. He is my shield, the one in whom I trust. He makes me reign over my people. 
3 O Yahweh, what is man so that you care about him. What is the son of man so that you pay attention to him. 
4 Man is like a breath, his days are like a shadow that vanishes. 
5 Bow your heavens and come down, O Yahweh. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke. 
6 Cast a lightning, and scatter your enemies. Shoot your arrows, and destroy them. 
7 Stretch out your hands from on high. Free me and preserve me from the great waters, and from the hand of strangers. 
8 The one whose mouth speaks deceit [without publicly acceptable justifications]. Their right hand is a right hand of falseness. 
9 I will sing a new song to you, O God. I will sing praises to you on a psaltery of ten strings. 
10 You are the one who gives salvation to kings, and who succors his servant David from the hurtful sword. 
11 Rescue and preserve me from the hand of strangers, the one whose mouth speaks deceit [without publicly acceptable justifications]. Their right hand is a right hand of falseness. 
12 Let our sons be like plants growing in their youth, and our daughters like carved pillars adorning palaces. 
13 Let our barns be full with an abundance of all kinds of products. Let our sheep multiply by thousands and by ten thousands in our streets. 
14 Let our oxen be fruitful. Let there be in our streets no disaster, and no captivity, and no crying. 
15 Happy is the people for whom this is done. Yes, happy is the people whose God is Yahweh.
