1 A psalm of David. It is good and pleasant for persons fearing God to work together. 
2 It is like the precious oil that is poured on the head of the high priest Aaron [or his chosen descendant] and which flows over his beard and the edge of his garments. 
3 It is like the dew of Hermon, which comes down on the mountain of Zion. For Yahweh has sent the blessing there, in order to give the life that endures forever.
