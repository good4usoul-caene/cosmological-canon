1 Comments on the epistles of the apostles and the gospels, first part: Falsifications.
2 The current contents of the Gospels have not always been as we see it. 
3 Over time, men's organizations have approved additions of different verses to the original version of the texts written in the language of the people that the man Jesus came to release (funny). 
4 For example, we know that Matthew 17:21 which is absent from the American Standard Version (ASV) and which is similar to Mark 9:29, was not present in the first translations.
5 But this kind of demon only comes out through prayer and fasting (Matthew 17:21). He said to them: This species can only come out through prayer (Mark 9:29).
6 This is also the case of Mark 16:16-20. 
7 He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these are the miracles that will accompany those who believe. In my name they will cast out demons, and they will speak new languages. And they will seize serpents, and if they drink any deadly drink then it will not harm them. And they will lay hands on the sick, and the sick will be healed. So after the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the miracles that accompanied it (Mark 16:16-20). 
8 And although the action described is confirmed by Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, we know that this is also the case of Luke 22:19-20,43-44. 
9 And also John 5:4 which is absent from ASV. [But it is the only possible explanation of John 5:7] 
10 And also John 7:53.
11 And also John 8:1-11. But I also think, like others, that this particular excerpt could really have happened.
12 And on my own initiative, I state that this is probably the case of Matthew 15:28 - 28:19.
13 Then Jesus answered and said to her: O woman, great is your faith. Let it be done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed at that same hour (Matthew 15:28).
14 Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.
15 Now, we know that any self-respecting falsifier must seek to confuse the tracks.
16 And I state that in my opinion, the Gospels of Luke and John are necessary and sufficient (after removing the verses I mentioned above) for one who wants to be interested in the words of the man Jesus. 
17 The New Testament canon from which I built my understanding of the christian faith consists of the following nineteen books: Gospel of Luke, and Gospel of John, and the Acts of the Apostles, and Paul(13), and Peter(2), and First John.
