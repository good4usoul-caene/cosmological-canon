1 A psalm of David, when he [his army] went to fight against the Syrians of Mesopotamia and the Syrians of Zobah, and when Joab returned and defeated twelve thousand Edomites in the valley of salt. O God, you have rejected us and you have scattered us because you were angry [at the end of Saul's reign]. Turn your face towards us once again. 
2 You have shaken the land and have torn it. Repair its breaches, for it is tottering. 
3 You have given your people many troubles, you have given us to drink the wine of astonishment.
4 But now you have given a banner to those who fear you, so that it may be displayed because of your truth. Pause. 
5 For you will save your beloved. Hear me and save us by your right hand. 
6 God has spoken in his holiness and has said: I will triumph, I will divide Shechem, I will measure the valley of Succoth. 
7 Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine. Ephraim is my helmet, and Judah is my lawgiver. 
8 Moab is my washbasin, and I cast my shoe on Edom. Land of the Philistines, shout for joy because of me. 
9 Now therefore, will you not bring me into the fortified city. Will you not lead me to Edom. 
10 Will you reject us again, O God. Will you not go with us in the midst of our armies, O God. 
11 It is in you that we will seek help in distress, for it is fruitless to seek only the help of men.
12 We will do valiantly through God, for it is he who will tread down our enemies.
