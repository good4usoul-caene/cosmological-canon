1 The psalm of David. Yahweh is my shepherd, I will not be short of anything. 
2 He makes me rest in green pastures, he leads me beside still waters. 
3 He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of his name. 
4 Even if I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil because you are with me. I am comforted by your rod and your staff. 
5 You prepare a table before me in the sight of my adversaries. You have anointed my head with oil, so that my cup overflows. 
6 Surely goodness and mercy will follow me during all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of Yahweh forever.
