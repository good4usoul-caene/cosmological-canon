1 Jeremiah the prophet said the following word to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book under the dictation of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. 
2 Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch.
3 You have said: Woe is me now. For Yahweh has added grief to my pain. I exhaust myself in sighing, and I find no rest. 
4 You will say the following thing to Baruch: Thus says Yahweh. Behold I will destroy what I have built, and I will uproot what I have planted, and this in the whole land. 
5 And you, should you seek great things for yourself. Do not seek them. For behold, I will bring disaster on all flesh, says Yahweh, but I will give you your life for a loot in all the places where you will go.
