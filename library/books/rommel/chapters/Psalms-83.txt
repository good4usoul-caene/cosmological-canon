1 A psalm of Asaph. Do not keep silence, O God. Do not hold your peace, do not remain inactive, O God. 
2 For lo, your enemies make a tumult. Those who hate you have lifted up the head. 
3 They have formed cunning plans against your people, they have prepared themselves to harm those who are in the secrets of your love. 
4 They have said: Come and we will destroy them, so that they may no longer be a nation. Let the name of Israel not be part of useful remembrances. 
5 They all consult with the same heart, they make an alliance against you. 
6 The tents of Edom, and of the ismaelites, and Moab, and the Hagarenes. 
7 And Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, and the Philistines, and the inhabitants of Tyre. 
8 Assyria also have joined them, they have helped the children of Lot. Pause. 
9 Do to them as you did to the Midianites, and as you did to Sisera and to Jabin at the river Kishon. 
10 They perished at Endor, and [their legacies] became like dung for the land. 
11 Make their leaders like Oreb and like Zeeb. Yes, all their princes like Zebah and like Zalmunna. 
12 For they have said, Let us take the dwellings [of the people] of God for our possession.
13 O my God, make them like the whirling dust, like the stubble carried by the wind. 
14 Be to them like the fire that burns a forest, or like the flame that sets the mountains on fire. 
15 Persecute them with your storm, make them tremble with your tempest.
16 Fill their faces with shame so that they may seek your name, O Yahweh. 
17 Let them be bewildered and troubled forever. Yes, let them be put to shame and perish. 
18 Let them know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, you are the Most High over all the Earth.
