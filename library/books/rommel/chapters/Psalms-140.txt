1 A psalm of David. Free me from the evil man, O Yahweh. Preserve me from the cruel man. 
2 Those who plan evil in their hearts, and are always enthusiastic about making war. 
3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent. The poison of asps is under their lips. Pause. 
4 Keep me from the hands of the wicked, O Yahweh. Preserve me from the cruel man who intends to cause my steps to slip. 
5 The proud have laid a snare for me. They have spread a net with cords on my way, and they have set themselves in ambush. Pause. 
6 But I say to Yahweh: You are my God. Hear the voice of my prayers, O Yahweh. 
7 You are the strength of my salvation, O Lord Yahweh. You cover my head in the day of battle. 
8 Do not satisfy all the desires of the wicked, O Yahweh. Do not perform all his plans, lest he exalt himself above you. Pause. 
9 As for those around me, let the iniquity of their own lips fall on them without delay. 
10 Let burning coals fall on them. Let them be cast them into the fire, into the deep pits from where they will not be able to rise again. 
11 For a backbiter will not be established on the earth. Evil will pursue the cruel man until his destruction. 
12 I know that Yahweh will preserve the powerless, and he will judge the needy with fairness. 
13 Surely the honest will praise your name, and the righteous will dwell in your presence.
