1 A psalm of David. If Yahweh had not been our refuge, then what would have happened to us. Let Israel give an answer. [For they have preserved the testimonies, and they are able to tell all that has happened whenever some of them have forsaken Yahweh.] 
2 If Yahweh had not been our refuge, then what would have happened when men rose up against us. 
3 They would have swallowed us up quickly, when their anger was kindled against us. 
4 The waters would have overwhelmed us. The stream would have passed over our souls. 
5 Our proud enemies would have been like raging floods overwhelming our souls. 
6 Blessed be Yahweh who has not given us to be a prey to their teeth. 
7 Our souls have escaped, like a bird who escapes from the snare of the fowler. The snare has broken, and we have escaped. 
8 Our help is in the name of Yahweh, the one who made the heaven and the earth.
