1 Preface to the Testament of Jesus Christ, second part. 
2 Jesus has prayed only to strengthen himself (4 Rommel 6:36) and he has spoken out loud so that we may trust the holy spirit and know how to strengthen ourselves (John 11:40-42 - 17:13-15 - Luke 11:1-4,13). 
3 When we come into the world, we do not know how to behave in order to archive our own goal without this being followed by any unpleasant surprise through cause and effect relationships. [For each person is free to set his own goals (John 1:35-39 - 16:23-24 - Proverbs 24:17-18 - 2 Thessalonians 3:1-5,6-16 - 2 Peter 2:9-19 - 4 Rommel 12:24-25). Ezra returned to Jerusalem in the seventh year of king Artaxerxes (Ezra 7:1-7,8-10), but the will to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem is an initiative of Nehemiah who returned to the promised land in the twentieth year of king Artaxerxes (Nehemiah 1:1-11 - 2:1-20 - 8:1-6 - 13:1-6). And even among the apostles of Christ who are filled with the Holy Spirit, each one can have his own opinion concerning the solution that is suitable in a particular context to achieve the only objective which is the glorification of the God of Israel (Acts 9:17-20 - 11:19-22,23-26 - 13:1-4 - 15:35-41 - Romans 14:1-5,6-13 - John 3:8).]
4 Perhaps we must trust people who are rich, or old people, or very strong people, or our parents regardless of our age (2 Chronicles 21:1-5 - Judges 9:1-5 - 1 Kings 12:10 - Job 32:1-10 - 2 Chronicles 15:16-17 - 22:8-12 - 2 Kings 6:26-29,30-31 - Isaiah 2:22).
5 Maybe we have to lie to everyone when there is no constraint and simply to protect our privacy or for fun (Zechariah 8:16-17 - 1 Samuel 25:14-38 - 2 Samuel 13:10-20 - 2 Kings 5:15-27 - John 3:20-21 - Isaiah 5:8-16).
6 Maybe we have to make human sacrifices (Jeremiah 7:31 - 32:35 - Judges 11:30-40 - Deuteronomy 23:21-23 - Leviticus 27:28-29 - Ezekiel 20:25-26,30-31), or call on the dead to ask them what our behavior should be among those who are alive (1 Samuel 28:11-15), or carefully observe the brightness of the night and the configuration of the most visible stars (2 Kings 21:6) in order to achieve our own goals with a lasting satisfaction (Jeremiah 9:23-24 - Habakkuk 2 - Isaiah 5:21-24). 
7 There is only one solution which is completely revealed by Jesus of Nazareth (2 Chronicles 9:7-8 - 1 Peter 1:18-25 - John 3:16 - Colossians 1:21-23) who created the following information in the world. 
8 While I am with you, you see what spirit I am animates with but you do not yet understand. The jews have a special day of the week that they call the sabbath, but I do not worry about it (John 5:16-18). 
9 The holy spirit has nothing to do with any periodic or genealogical law (John 15:22-27). The only important thing is to be concerned about the well-being of others in a global way without necessarily focusing on certain people in particular. 
10 The holy spirit has nothing to do with any commandment (4 Rommel 6:25). The only important thing is to be sincerely concerned about the well-being of others in a global way without necessarily focusing on certain people in particular, even not on oneself. 
11 Moses does not know the exact identity of God and when he addresses prayers to the angels for the cause of the people, this above all allows God to examine the mind of Moses. And the holy spirit and we ourselves see that Moses is a pleasant man (Exodus 32:30-35 - Deuteronomy 9:7-23,24-29 - 1 Corinthians 2:9-10). And Yahweh could indeed destroy the people whose behavior offended him and use only Moses and a few others like Joshua, and the children who were among the people and who could not be considered to be completely guilty because of their young ages, to establish the inheritance of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, but that would not have given importance to the miracles which he performed in Egypt to free the descendants of Jacob (Deuteronomy 32:26-28 - Ezekiel 20:6-14) and all those who joined them (Exodus 12:37-38). Jonah did not know the exact definition of eternal life but just a vague idea of what it is (Job 14:10-15 - 1 Rommel 1:33), and he would prefer that God send someone else to make a fool of himself by announcing a real disaster that will never happen (Jonah 1:1-3 - 4:1-4). It is possible that the angels have already used him in this way a number of times, and it is for this reason that Jonah had fled, but we can think that Jonah is not perfect (Jonah 4:5-11 - 1 Rommel 3:20) as Moses was not perfect (1 Rommel 3:7). 
12 It is when I will be killed and resurrected that you will truly understand my message (John 12:32-34 - 19:14-16 - Daniel 7:13-15). 
13 I bear witness to the power of the holy spirit who is my father and the father of all my brothers (Luke 12:11-12). And those whose father he is not are destined to live in the pleasures of the world and to disappear without leaving anything really interesting or useful in the world. If all their works are not destroyed over time, what remains will have at best a secondary use. 
14 I am the way and the truth and the life, and I give you a unique commandment (John 13:34-35 - 14:1-7). 
15 If you obey then I (Luke 21:14-15 - John 14:18-21) and my father (Luke 12:11-12 - John 14:22-26) will live in your body. You will be the temple of God in the same way that my body is the temple of God (John 2:19-21). 
16 Give up all the rituals and tricks that you learned from your parents or neighbors or that you yourself invented (Jeremiah 16:19-21 - 1 Thessalonians 4:1-8), and attach yourself only to me alone, to what I taught you, to my only commandment, and teach this to everyone (Numbers 27:15-17 - John 10:1-16). 
17 The jewish people desire a prince who is submitted to God by a high priest fully engaged in service in the temple of God (Numbers 27:18-23 - Judges 17:6-13 - 18:13-20 - Ezekiel 37:21-23,24-25,26-28), a temple of God built by the hand of man (Ezekiel 43:10-12 - 44:1-5 - 46:1-3,8-10 - Isaiah 6). I am this prince and this high priest and this temple of God, and my disciples are a kingdom of priests to God the Father and to God the holy spirit (Exodus 19:1-9). 
18 Concerning the prophecies about the return of a few selected individuals from the families of the tribes that were scattered more than a century before Ezekiel, they were fulfilled after Ezekiel when a part of the tribe of Judah returned from Babylon to build the second temple. And since these returns there has been no king in Israel (Joshua 23 - 2 Kings 17:1-23 - 25:1-22 - 1 Chronicles 5:10,18-26 - Amos 9:7-15 - Jeremiah 3:1-16 - 23:5-8 - 25:9-12 - 30:1-24 - 32:25-44 - Ezekiel 16:44-55,56-59,60-61,62-63 - 20:27-44 - 34:11-24 - Nehemiah 6:1-9,10-14 - Luke 1:26-35 - John 19:28-30). The word of Yahweh was given by Zechariah during the rebuilding of the house of Yahweh by children of Israel who had already returned from captivity from Babylon and perhaps from elsewhere (Zechariah 8:1-15 - Ezra 6:14), and other children of Israel returned voluntarily to the promised land from Babylon and perhaps from elsewhere later in the seventh year of one of the kings of Persia surnamed Artaxerxes (Ezra 7:1-10 - 8:1-14,15-36), and Nehemiah took the initiative to return to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem later in the twentieth year of that same king of Persia (Nehemiah 1:1-11 - 2:1-9) since Ezra is a contemporary of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 8:1-6). And Ezekiel even provided that foreigners could own plots of land that will be their inheritance when the prince comes (Ezekiel 47:13-14,21-23 - 1 Rommel 3:49). [Now the rebuilding of the house of God was completed in the sixth year of Darius king of Persia whose kingdom included Jerusalem (Ezra 6:15-18), and this Darius continued to reign for nearly thirty years after this event, and after that there was a Persian king surnamed Ahasuerus who reigned for nearly twenty years (Esther 2:16-17 - 3:7-8 - 9:1-2), and after that there was the king surnamed Artaxerxes who gave permissions to Ezra and Nehemiah.]
19 You are free to use your imagination to create different forms of schools of faith to attract the attention of different populations who have varying traditions, but the message must be the same (1 Corinthians 3:9-15). 
20 In the flesh you will die as I will die, but if you persevere then I promise you that in spirit you will live in the same way that I will be eternally alive, and some of you will have the privilege of witnessing my resurrection (Acts 10:39-43). And they will be continuously alive through this information that they will transmit to you (John 17:24). 
21 Therefore dwell in me and sin no more (Ephesians 4:17-32 - John 3:16-18 - Isaiah 59). 
22 When a community is rejected by God, it is not individuals who are rejected but the practices that characterize the existence of these communities and constitute their inheritance (Deuteronomy 23:1-6 - Ruth 1:4,16 - Judges 11:1-11 - 2 Kings 10:28-31 - 14:23-27 - 4 Rommel 2:26 - 11:31).  
23 Indeed the inheritance of the knowledge of God that comes from Abraham and from one of his sons named Isaac (Genesis 16:1-16 - 18:9-14 - 21:1-5 - 25:1-6), was integrally transmitted to Jacob (Genesis 28:10-15 - 35:9-12) by excluding his twin brother Esau (Genesis 25:21-26 - Malachi 1:1-3 - Ezekiel 33:23-29). And this inheritance is me (Genesis 12:1-4 - 18:18-19 - 22:15-18 - John 8:19-25 - Colossians 2:1-3). 
24 After this clarification of the teaching of Jesus, I want to tell that it is important to make the link between all the writings of the same author, at least in the same book, to understand the meaning given to the words used.
25 For example poverty (Luke 6:20 - 12:16-21 - 18:18-22,23-27,28-30 - 5 Rommel 7:2), or anger (Proverbs 19:11 - 29:11 - Ecclesiastes 7:9 - Philippians 4:5 - Proverbs 13:24 - 22:6 - Luke 18:15-17 - John 2:13-17 - 2 Corinthians 7:8-12 - Ephesians 4:26), or killing (Exodus 20:13 - 21:12-14 - Leviticus 24:17-22 - Numbers 35:9-34 - Deuteronomy 5:17 - 19:1-13,16-21), and also educational depictions such as the writing of the ten commandments on an artistically worked thing (Exodus 20:4 - 25:16-17,18-22 - 26:1,31 - Deuteronomy 5:8 - 6:6-9 - 11:18-20 - Joshua 4:1-9,20-24 - Leviticus 8:5-9 - Judges 17:1-5). And Solomon had an impressive throne made to visually describe the severity of his impartial judgment (1 Kings 7:7-8 - 10:18-20 - 2 Chronicles 9:17-19).
26 Old forms of master-slaves relationships where the one is supposed to continuously provide day and night for all the needs of the other have evolved (Exodus 21:5-6 - Deuteronomy 28:68 - Leviticus 19:20). For it is God the Father who afflicts the ones possibly through others (Ruth 1:20 - Jeremiah 27:1-8). 
27 And with abuses and revolts and regulations, these relationships take new forms between employees and employers (Galatians 3:28 - Colossians 3:18-25 - 1 Peter 2:17-20). But as with obedience to parents, the holy spirit defines the limits of all things (Ephesians 6:1-9 - 1 Kings 2:19-23 - 15:11-14).
28 Moses' pedagogy was temporary and with a family character (Galatians 3:19-26). For it was a pedagogy in which everyone simply had to do his best (Leviticus 4:27-32 - 5:5-11 - 12:8 - 14:9-11,21-23,31-32 - 27:8). 
29 And it was not genealogy that was rejected in this pedagogy set forth by the angels of Yahweh (Deuteronomy 20:1,10-15 - 21:10-17 - Isaiah 56:3-8 - Judges 1:16 - 2 Samuel 15:13-22 - 1 Kings 11:1-3 - 14:21,31 - 2 Chronicles 12:13) but only idolatrous practices (Genesis 15:16 - Exodus 23:27-33 - Deuteronomy 20:15-18 - 1 Kings 11:4-10 - 4 Rommel 6:26-29,30-32).
30 But the message of Jesus Christ is universal and permanent (Ephesians 2:11-22) as manifested in the following prayer.
31 Lord Jesus Christ, you taught me that all human beings are equal in your sight and that the only thing that you ask is the spirit of righteousness in the hearts (1 Corinthians 5:6-8 - Colossians 3:11). 
32 Everything in the universe belongs to you, and we each have the right to do whatever we want (2 Samuel 7:3 - 1 Chronicles 17:2 - Psalms 132:1-9) but only to serve you (1 Corinthians 3:21-23 - Colossians 3:17).
