1 And seven women will take hold of one man in that day by saying: We will eat our own bread, and we will wear our own garments. Only take away our shame by allowing us be called by your name. 
2 In that day the branch of Yahweh will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be excellent and pleasant for those of Israel who will have endured. 
3 And the remnant of Zion, and the remnant of Jerusalem, they will be called holy. And every one in Jerusalem will be written among the living. 
4 And the Lord will wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and he will cleanse Jerusalem from the blood that is in its midst. He will do it by the spirit of justice which burns like fire. 
5 And Yahweh will set over all Mount Zion and over its assemblies a smoking cloud by day and a flaming fire by night [that is to say, the similarity in purpose to what led the people into the wilderness in the days of Moses]. For all that is glorious will be covered. 
6 There will be a shelter for a shade from the heat of the day, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
