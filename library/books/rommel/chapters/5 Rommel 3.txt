1 The identity of God.
2 Science aims to establish knowledge about the work of God and experiment is then used to purify speculations, while the holy scriptures reveal the will of the creator. 
3 It is written that God knows in advance those who will have eternal life consequently his word must come where it is needed to convince those who must be through this procedure.
4 The sky, which is the throne of God, is the place of residence of abstract concepts. 
5 God is the notion of truth, and Christ who is his only begotten Son is the notion of love of the general interest, and all souls have been created in the image of God and are also abstract concepts. The hand of God is the laws of nature that scientists seek (John 14:9-10 - 1:18 - 4:24 - Romans 1:20-23 - 1 Timothy 6:16 - Isaiah 48:12-13 - Jeremiah 23:23-24 - Psalms 139:6-12 - John 6:61-63 - 1 Corinthians 15:35-38,42-50 - Luke 20:34-38 - John 12:23-26). 
6 God creates the spirit of man in his image, and no element of creation, being alive or being inert, is the creator. 
7 The story of creation is necessarily a metaphor chosen by the holy spirit to describe a complex process that it is up to us to specify.
8 Because God loves that man seeks him, he wants all men to reason like scientists and that there be no idolater (Isaiah 45:18-20 - Acts 17:24-31 - Psalms 146:3-6 - Isaiah 2:22). 
9 The body of man is not in the image of God, and the chronology which is exposed in the story of creation (three days, morning and evening successions, are elapsed before the creation of the sun) was not conceived from a human perspective (2 Peter 3:8).
10 Even the discovery of a form of extraterrestrial life cannot question the nature of God and the word of God.
