1 A psalm of Asaph. Sing with joy to God our strength. Shout joyfully to the God of Jacob. 
2 Choose a song and bring the tambourine, and the pleasant harp, and the psaltery. 
3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon and at all the appointed times for our feasts. 
4 For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 
5 He set this in Joseph for a testimony, when he came out of the land of Egypt, where I heard a language that I did not understand. 
6 I have withdrawn his shoulder from the burden, his hands have been freed from the pots. 
7 You cried in distress and I save you, I answered you from the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Pause. 
8 Hear, O my people, and I will warn you. If you were willing to listen to me, O Israel. 
9 Let there be no strange god among you, and do not worship any foreign god. 
10 For I am Yahweh your God, the one who brought you out of the land of Egypt. Open wide your mouth, and I will fill it. 
11 But my people did not want to hear my voice. Israel did not obey me. 
12 Therefore I have let them walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and they have walked in their own counsels. 
13 Oh if my people were willing to listen to me, if Israel were willing to walk in my ways. 
14 Then I would have humbled their enemies, I would have turned my hand against their adversaries. 
15 Those who hate Yahweh would have been subdued, and the legacies of my servants would have lasted forever.
16 My servants would have been fed with the best wheat, and I would have satisfied them with honey from the rock.
