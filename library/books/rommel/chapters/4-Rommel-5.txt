1 The Father and the Son and the holy spirit (John 1:17 - 10:30), second part: Intrinsic nature of embodied heavenly bodies.
2 Human beings are incarnations of abstract concepts therefore each one always acts according to one’s nature but the complexity and subtleties of the different contexts can can highlight contrasts (2 Kings 21:1-16 - 2 Chronicles 33:10-17).
3 By definition, to be born by being indwelled by the holy spirit so as to be physically sinless (Romans 6:22-23 - 1 Timothy 3:16 - Luke 24:1-5), one must be an incarnation of Christ or a reincarnation of a spirit who has already had knowledge of the purpose of life after necessarily offending the holy spirit. 
4 So if Jesus of Nazareth who teaches the exact knowledge of God paid a compliment following what is clearly an offense to the holy spirit (John 1:45-47 - Genesis 18:9-15) as Jonathan David Doolin pointed out to me, Jesus having the ability to see beyond physical appearance as he sees things happening at a distance (John 1:48-50), it is to teach that an ordinary person cannot be without sin and that one is a child of Israel by training one’s mind in holiness (1 Kings 15:5 - 1 Rommel 3:20).
5 Balaam who was not a member of the tribes of Israel had the gift of cursing and blessing (Numbers 22:5-6,10-12 - 23:8-10) but not being Jesus Christ he committed sins. 
6 Ahithophel had the gift of discerning the way God the Father acted (2 Samuel 15:31 - 16:23 - 17:14) but not being Jesus Christ he committed sins. 
7 This other remark which is not mine but Daniel Keeran's is that the virgin Mary who had the gift of giving birth to the Incarnation of Christ by the power of the holy spirit (Luke 1:30-35 - 2:8-19) did not live without sin (Luke 2:41-50) and therefore it can be said that she was not a reincarnation of a spirit that had already known the truth. 
8 Finally, Jesus of Nazareth by definition lived without sin and he had the gift of forgiving others for the sins they committed by offending their fellowmen (Luke 5:17-26) because he was the incarnation of Christ which is the concept by which these sins are erased, that is, to obtain the forgiveness of those who have been offended without possible public justification. 
9 However, the manifestation of this particular gift is not always visible (Luke 7:36-48,49-50) and for a specialist of the Hebrew Bible, Jesus did nothing extraordinary except to persuade himself that he died while maintaining a good conscience in all circumstance even in relation to those who are not of his nation (Luke 4:25-27).
10 Indeed, Jesus was born of a virgin woman (Luke 1:34-35) and therefore his father is not a man but it was not a first in history (Genesis 6:1-4). 
11 Jesus changed the water to wine (John 2:1-11) but Moses changed the sea to blood (Exodus 7:17-20). 
12 Jesus multiplied the breads and the fishes (John 6:9-13) but Elijah multiplied the flour and the oil (1 Kings 17:14-16).
13 Jesus threatened the storm and walked on the water (Luke 8:22-25 - John 6:16-21) but Moses opened the sea (Exodus 14:21).  
14 Jesus rose from the dead according to the flesh (John 11:38-44) and he himself rose (John 20:11-17) but Elijah did the same (1 Kings 17:20-24). 
15 Jesus spoke with living spirits (Luke 9:28-36) but Saul also had an exchange with the spirit of Samuel (1 Samuel 28:11-15).
16 Jesus was taken up into heaven (Luke 24:50-51) but also Elijah (2 Kings 2:11).
17 And Elisha also did similar things (2 Kings 2:7-10).
