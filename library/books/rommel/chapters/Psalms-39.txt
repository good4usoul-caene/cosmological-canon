1 A psalm of David. I had said: I will watch over my ways, lest I sin with my tongue. I will put a bridle on my mouth whenever there will be wicked men before me.
2 Therefore I not only refrained from saying words that could have been misinterpreted, but I also refrained from saying good words. And I became sad. 
3 And my heart burned within me. And the more I thought about it, the sadder I became. Therefore I opened my mouth and spoke the following words. 
4 O Yahweh, let me know what my end will be. And let me know how many days I have, so that I may be aware of the short time that I have left to live. 
5 Behold you have made my days as the width of a hand, for my lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely every man in his best state is nothing but vanity. Pause. 
6 Doubtless man walks in a shadow, and disquiets himself in vain. He gathers riches without having certainty about who will use them after his death, because unforeseeable events can happen at any time to anyone. 
7 And now, Lord, what can I hope. My hope is in you. 
8 Save me from the consequences of all my transgressions [because I have acknowledged them by following the procedure indicated in your law]. Do not allow me to become an example not to follow in the mouths of fools.
9 I should be silent and not open my mouth, because you are the one who is acting. 
10 But I want to make supplications to my judge. Stop your attacks against me, because I am falling under the hits of your hand. 
11 You rebuke man by punishing him for his iniquity. You cause the physical beauty of his achievements to become like a garment damaged by moths. Surely every man [in his best state] is nothing but vanity. Pause. 
12 Hear my prayer, O Yahweh. Give ear to my cry, do not keep silent about my tears. For I am a sojourner and a pilgrim in your world of the living, like all my fathers.
13 Turn your anger away from me, so that I may experience true joy before death sets me aside.
