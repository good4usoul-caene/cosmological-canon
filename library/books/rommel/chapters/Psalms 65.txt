1 A psalm of David. They will praise you in Zion, O God, and they will fulfill their vows.
2 Anyone can come to you, and you will hear his prayer. 
3 Wicked deeds have prevailed against me, but you will be merciful to our transgressions. [They are committed by the people of whom I am king and they influence the nature of the difficulties I must face.] 
4 Blessed is he whom you will choose to make him come into your presence and dwell in your courtyards [of the house that will be built for your name]. We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, of your holy temple. 
5 You will answer us with scary signs in your righteousness, O God of our salvation. You are the hope of all the ends of the earth, even of those who live far away across the sea. 
6 He establishes the mountains by his power, he is girded with strength. 
7 He calms the roaring of the seas namely the roaring of their waves, and also the tumult of the peoples. 
8 Those who live at the ends of the earth will be afraid of your wonders. You will fill the east and the west with joy. 
9 You visit the land and water it, and you fill it with riches. The river of God is full of water, and you use it to prepare the ground in order to provide grain. 
10 You water its furrows abundantly, you make rain fall into its valleys. You make it soft with showers, and you bless its buds. 
11 You crown the beginning of the year with your goodness, and your steps throughout the year pour out abundance.
12 Your water drop on the pastures of the wilderness, and the hills are girded with joy. 
13 The pastures are covered with sheep, and the valleys are clothed with grain. Therefore they shout for joy and sing.
