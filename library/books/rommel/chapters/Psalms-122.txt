1 A psalm of David. I rejoice when they say to me: Let us go to the house of Yahweh. 
2 Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem. 
3 Jerusalem is built as a compact city. 
4 It is where the tribes come to praise the name of Yahweh, in accordance with an ordinance given to the people of Israel. It is the holy place for all the tribes of Yahweh. 
5 And thrones of justice will be there, the thrones of the kings from the house of David. 
6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. May those who love you prosper. 
7 May there be peace in your walls, and prosperity in your palaces. 
8 Because of my brothers and friends, I desire your prosperity. [It is through you that Yahweh will cause my name to endure forever, as he has promised me.] 
9 Because of the house of Yahweh our God [which is within your walls], I will seek your good.
