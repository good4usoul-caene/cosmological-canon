1 O Israel, return to Yahweh your God. For you have fallen by your iniquity. 
2 Bring words with you, and return to Yahweh. Say to him: Forgive all iniquities, and receive us graciously. We offer you the obedience of our lips instead of bullocks. 
3 The Assyrian will not save us. We will not ride on horses to look for help, and we will no longer say to the work of our hands, 'You are our gods'. For the fatherless finds mercy in you. 
4 I will heal their rebellion, and I will show them my love without limits. For my anger will turn away from them. 
5 I will be like the dew to Israel. He will blossom like the lily, and take root like the trees of Lebanon. 
6 His branches will spread, and his beauty will be like the olive tree, and his smell will be like Lebanon. 
7 They will return and dwell under his shadow. They will revive like the wheat, and blossom like the vine. Their scent will be like the wine of Lebanon. 
8 Ephraim will say, 'What have I to do any more with idols'. I will hear him, and I will look at him. I am like a green fir tree, and it is from me that you receive your fruit. 
9 Whoever is wise, let him understand these things. Whoever is prudent, let him know them. For the ways of Yahweh are righteous, and the honest persons will walk in them, and the transgressors will fall there.
