1 Jotham was twenty five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned [alone] sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother was called Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 
2 And he did what was right in the sight of Yahweh according to all that Uzziah his father had done, but he did not enter the holy place of the house of Yahweh [as his father had done]. And the people were continuing to corrupt their ways. 
3 Jotham built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and he made a lot of constructions on the walls of Ophel. 
4 Moreover Jotham built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers. 
5 And Jotham fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him one hundred talents of silver the same year, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. And the children of Ammon gave him the same things in the second year, and also in the third. 
6 So Jotham became powerful, because he directed his ways toward Yahweh his God. 
7 Concerning the remaining of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
8 Jotham was twenty five when he became king, and he reigned sixteen in Jerusalem. 
9 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
