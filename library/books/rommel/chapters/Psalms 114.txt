1 When Israel went out of Egypt, when the house of Jacob departed from the brutish people [who oppressed them]. 
2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his kingdom. 
3 The sea saw it and fled. And the Jordan was driven back. 
4 The mountains leaped like rams, and the hills like lambs. 
5 What is troubling you, O sea, so that you are fleeing. Why have you turned back, O Jordan. 
6 You mountains, why have you leaped like rams. And you hills, why have you leaped like lambs.
7 The earth trembled at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob. 
8 The one who turned the rock into a pool of water, and the flint into a fountain of waters.
