1 General preface, third part: The humor of Yahweh and the principle of the proportional response.
2 Living beings make all kinds of inventions to improve their living conditions [possibly for a supposed afterlife] or to wage war against each other. But concerning all the books that I present here, what is the exact justification for their inventions (1 Rommel 3:45 - 4 Rommel 8:1-4). Indeed, it is impossible to alter the only useful message that must be retained from the bible (4 Rommel 1:1-12,13-25 - 2:62-65 - 4:3-4 - 14:1-4,10-11 - 3 Rommel 1:26-30 - 2:1-10 - 2 Rommel 8 - 1 Rommel 1:34 - 3:30-32 - It is not necessary to succeed in proving that the biblical characters have really existed in the past. Indeed, on the one hand the one who transmits a message is at least one of the authors of the message which is actually received from the point of view of any receiver - Jeremiah 23:28-32 - and on the other hand what we must call Jesus Christ is only the information of the exact definition of eternal life - 3 Rommel 1:8-9 - 2 Corinthians 5:16-17,18-21 - John 14:15-26 - Acts 25:19 - 1 John 1:1-4 - Jeremiah 31:31-36 - Isaiah 66:7-8 - 5 Rommel 2:10-19 - 6:1-9 - Daniel 2). But it is possible to alter the teachings that allow us to have enough discernment to fully benefit from this unique message (2 Timothy 3:14-17 - 1 Corinthians 10:11 - Romans 15:4 - Ephesians 2:20-22). The totality of the teachings of all biblical scriptures is contained in the five books of the Torah of Moses (Genesis - Exodus - Leviticus - Numbers - Deuteronomy) to which we can add the book of Job to emphasize the notion of contextual intention.
3 The explanations of some curiosities seem impossible because of their unusual characters. For example, the three dead who were resurrected at the time of the kings of Israel, or the  disappearance of the prophet Elijah which was reproduced by Jesus of Nazareth and which could only have existed once in the past when Enoch disappeared (Genesis 5:21-24 - 4 Rommel 14:12), or the sun that stood still in the sky in the time of Joshua according to the point of view of those who were watching it [or the rotational movement of the earth around itself could have been temporarily disrupted by an unknown event as I have read somewhere]. But if we focus only on the useful teaching that the bible asks to reproduce, according to which all human beings are equal and each is responsible for his actions (3 Rommel 2:22-23,28-29 - 4 Rommel 12:24-25), then we can understand why some numbers might have been falsified as the chronology of 2 Kings 15 [Or Jeremiah 27:1 that must contain the name of Zedekiah and not of Jehoiakim, and that it is easy to correct by looking at Jeremiah 27:3,20 and Jeremiah 28:1. Or Daniel 1:1 that it is easy to correct by looking at Jeremiah 25:1 and 2 Kings 24:1,12 - Jeremiah 52:28-31]. There are also some difficulties with the genealogies of 1 Chronicles 6 but it is better not to dwell on them because the word son is sometimes used to designate a descendant (1 Chronicles 8:40 - Ezra 8:1-2,17-18), and different persons can have the same name and they are then distinguished by specifying the names of their fathers or their cities of origin or their functions, and the same person is sometimes called by two different names (Joshua the servant of Moses was first called Hosea). 
4 However there is also a variation regarding the identities and glorious deeds of the three most bravest men who served David, depending on the source of the author of the book of Samuel and the source of the author of the book of Chronicles (2 Samuel 23:8-12 - 1 Chronicles 11:10-14), but this does not in any way call into question the definition of the notion of holy spirit who is the true God of Israel for whom the quality of intentions are more important than facts as in the book of Job (4 Rommel 2:19). For it is not what a person does that is interesting but only the inner motivations that are the concerns of that person in the particular context of the events (Exodus 21:12-14 - Deuteronomy 19:16-21 - 25:11-12 - 3 Rommel 1:25 - 2:24-25 - 2 Rommel 21-24). Moreover, the sources used by a person who acts under the influence of the spirit may not report the facts accurately and the only thing that can be expected from this person is the superior quality of all the actually useful aspects of the teachings that he wants to transmit (2 Kings 9:21-28 - 10:12-14 - 2 Chronicles 22:7-9 - 1 Chronicles 27:23-24 - Luke 24:1-12 - John 20:1-18 - 1 Rommel 2:23-24). [When comparing the narratives in the book of Kings and the book of Chronicles, it is also important to know that the chronological order is not necessarily strictly observed. For example, it is evident that Jeremiah 42:19-22 occurred before Jeremiah 43:1-4] 
5 Language is only used to transmit information, and a same message can be formulated in different ways in order to highlight nuances in the meaning of the words used in certain expressions and thus avoid misinterpretation (4 Rommel 11:32-39). Consequently the same spirit of God may not use the same words to describe a same reality when it speaks through two different people, or when he speaks a second time to the same person (2 Corinthians 3:12-18). This appears in the establishment of the sabbath day because we are on the sixth day of the creation (Exodus 20:8-11 - 31:13-18 - Psalms 121 - Deuteronomy 5:12-15 - 1 Rommel 2:7 - 4 Rommel 12:4-6), and elsewhere as in the answers that God gives to the prophet Nathan the seer of David according to the source of the book of Samuel and according to the different source of the book of chronicles (2 Samuel 7:1-17 - 1 Chronicles 17:1-15). 
6 In reality, the expression 'to love Jesus' (John 13:34-35 - 14:15 - 15:12,17 - Luke 10:16 - John 13:16,20 - 4 Rommel 12:53-56 - 11:32-39) means not to love your own life (Psalms 111:2 - 115:1 - Luke 9:23-26,27-29 - 14:25-27 - 4 Rommel 8:15) but to rejoice only in the glorification of the holy spirit in everything that you do (Isaiah 1:10-20 - 28:14-17 - 40:25 - 42:8 - Amos 8:4-7 - Jeremiah 9:23-24 - Luke 17:10 - John 5:24 - 12:42-46 - 1 John 2:15-17 - Colossians 3:23-25 - Daniel 4:29-37). And it also means being angry in the presence of any injustice (Luke 3:1-16 - 1 Samuel 15:30-35 - Psalms 110 - 5 Rommel 9:11-18). In other words it is about realizing that nothing is equal to the beauty of the soul of the Lord Jesus (3 Rommel 1:31-34,43-44 - 2:16-18 - Job 28 - Deuteronomy 3:23-27). Therefore there is a striking contrast between on the one hand the seriousness and the intensity of the emotions released by the testament of Jesus Christ despite the joyful nature of his unique teaching (John 16:22 - Philippians 4:4 - 1 Thessalonians 5:16 - 5 Rommel 7 - It is not about laughing stupidly all the time, but it is just about not being sad or do anything without a motivation that is pleasant to the holy spirit. For one cannot repent of an inappropriate behavior without being sad - Psalms 51:17 - Ecclesiastes 7:1-4), and on the other hand the comical nature of the behavior of the guilty in the Hebrew Bible despite the extreme brutality of the events described there (Exodus 14–16 - Numbers 13–14 - 16–17 - 2 Samuel 10:1-7).  
7 And Moses who calls others rebels while he himself does not trust God enough since he did not simply speak to the rock but struck it and more than once (Numbers 20:1-13). For Abraham has trusted God and consequently God has accused him of being morally justifiable (Genesis 15:6). And Abraham was not the first of his kind (Genesis 5:21-24). It is remarkable that this event took place at Kadesh shortly before the death of the high priest Aaron (Numbers 33:1-3,36-39) and yet a similar event had already occurred at Rephidim in the first three months of their journey (Exodus 17:1-7 - 19:1-2 - Numbers 33:12-15 - 27:12-14 - Deuteronomy 32:48-52). 
8 But the accurate knowledge of God's humor begins with Aaron's legacy [a legacy is not only a material object but also a knowledge]. 
9 Since his true guilt lies elsewhere (Numbers 20:10-12,22-29), we must think that Aaron acted under duress (Exodus 32:21-25,31-35) in the hope of a rapid return of Moses and in order to prevent the dispersion of the people. 
10 And this now is a main characteristic of God: he takes seriously the one who honors him even if he may at the same time distress the spirit of such a person because of his past or his genealogy, and the same God forgives the one who does not glorify him completely [for Aaron has already listened to the angel’s instructions with all the people (Exodus 20)] but also mocks such a person in a way that sometimes requires a long time to be clarify (Exodus 28:9-21,29-38 - 29:29-30 - Galatians 6:7). [The angels of Yahweh never speak to make anyone laugh. The thing that can be comical for us who now know the exact identity of God, it is only the nature of the instructions that they give in response to a transgression and in order to carry out a punishment. And a laugh is inappropriate if it is not caused by the observation of a lack of common sense in a particular deed of a person who is also displaying his pride in the same event. At a time when the exact identity of God is still unknown, Jesus of Nazareth feeds the people in a miraculous way (John 6:1-13) and then he feels compelled to flee and hide in order to avoid being forced by these people to become their king (John 6:14-15,22-26,27-31,32-34). For Jesus knows that his destiny is not to become one of the kings that we see with our eyes, but rather the king inside the hearts (John 6:35-42,43-52,53-60,61-66,67-71 - 14:18-26).] 
11 For Moses speaks with Yahweh, and also several prophets after him, without needing all this somewhat ridiculous clothing (Genesis 6:5-13 - 15:1 - 20:3 - 46:1-4 - 48:1-4 - Exodus 3:1-6 - 4:27-29 - 25:21-22 - Numbers 22:5-13 - 24:1-4 - Judges 6:7-10 - 1 Samuel 2:27-30 - 2 Chronicles 7:11-12 - 1 Kings 3:5,15 - 19:1-15 - Amos 7:10-15 - Daniel 9:17-23 - Ezra 5:1-2 - Haggai 1:12-15 - 2:1-5,10-15,20-23 - Acts 10:1-8,9-20 - 3 Rommel 1:22). [It is therefore not surprising that the normal use of the ark of the covenant by Aaron and his descendants has never been mentioned (1 Rommel 3:35).]
12 And Aaron's successors [the one who is chosen from among his descendants to be the high priest (Exodus 29:29-30 - Numbers 20:25-29 - Deuteronomy 10:6)] will need the ark of the covenant to speak with God once a year, and apart from this occasion they will need two items called Urim and Thummim (Exodus 28:30 - Numbers 27:18-23 - Judges 20:26-28) which they will use with an ephod (Exodus 28:4-6 - 29:4-5 - 1 Samuel 14:2-3,17-19) to consult the word of God as it will be the case for the other Levites, or maybe not all the Levites but only the priests who are the descendants of Aaron, after the people had dispersed each in his own territory in the promised land (Judges 17:6-13 - 18:13-20 - 1 Samuel 14:37-39,40-42). [The ephod is used to obtain no and yes answers to a succession of cleverly asked questions, and sometimes there is no answer (1 Samuel 14:36-37), and the spirit of Yahweh might have sometimes spoken to a priest while he was looking for an information. And after a while the spirit of Yahweh spoke to some of the priests in a more natural way (2 Chronicles 24:17-22 - Jeremiah 1:1-10 - 31:23-26 - Ezekiel 1:1-3) as he spoke to a woman (Exodus 15:20-21 - Judges 4:4-9 - 2 Kings 22:8-15) or as he spoke to men who are neither priests nor Levites like Samuel the prophet (1 Samuel 1:1-28 - 3:16-21 - 9:10-13,14-20). For it was Eli and his sons who were priests in the house of Yahweh (1 Samuel 1:3 - 2:27-30 - 4:12-18)] 
13 Meanwhile, David comes from Bethlehem of the tribe of Judah and the spirit of Yahweh speaks through him (1 Samuel 23:1-6 - 28:6,15 - 2 Samuel 23:1-2) and also through other prophets recognized as such during their lifetime. And these recognized prophets sometimes speak more directly with the angels of Yahweh (2 Chronicles 29:25 - 1 Samuel 9:9 - 2 Samuel 24:11-12,17-19 - 1 Chronicles 21:9-10,16-19). [In these latter references, David’s responsibility is partly transferred to the people who previously asked God to establish a king over them but this is not the only reason (4 Rommel 6:30-32)] 
14 But the legacy that each person gives to the world depends solely on his personal relationship with God and do not depend on his genealogy (Exodus 32:33 - Leviticus 10:1-7 - 1 Chronicles 24:1-2 - Numbers 14:26-35 - Deuteronomy 1:34-40 - 24:16 - Ecclesiastes 6:1-6 - 1 Kings 14:10-13 - Ezekiel 14:12-23 - 18:1-20 - 4 Rommel 2:26). Jonadab the son of Rechab created his own legacy (2 Kings 10:15-23,24-28), and his children created their own legacy (Jeremiah 35). The children of Moses according to the flesh did not particularly benefit from his legacy, and yet even his father in law participated in a significant way, and this is not related to the fact that their mother did not come from the tribes of Israel (3 Rommel 2:29). Indeed the mother of Rehoboam was also a foreigner (1 Kings 14:21,31) and nevertheless he was the first king of the kingdom of Judah established to perpetuate the legacy of David, a part of this legacy having the particularity of being linked to the function of king in the midst of the children of Jacob. For it is through this authority that David had the will to replace the most holy place [the closed room made of curtains which must receive the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and where the high priest enters only once a year] by something more beautiful and more durable (2 Samuel 7:1-3 - 1 Chronicles 28:1-7,12-19 - 2 Chronicles 4:1 - 7:7 - 2 Kings 16:7-18 - Exodus 38:1-2). And concerning the children of Moses according to the flesh (Exodus 6:16-20 - 1 Chronicles 23:12-17): Moses had sent away his wife and his two children before his return to Egypt, one of whom had just been born because the circumcision must be done on the eighth day after birth (Exodus 2:16-25 - 4:18-26 - Genesis 17:8-13). We know that he sent them away [to avoid having to worry about them constantly] because they were brought back to Moses after the children of Israel had come out of Egypt (Exodus 18:1-7), and therefore they participated in the sins of the people concerning the golden calf made by Aaron, but they then turned away from that sin with the other members of the tribe of Levi (Exodus 32:26-30). 
15 Therefore the promise that the spirit made to David (2 Samuel 7:4-16 - 3 Rommel 1:10-13) cannot be corrupted by the behavior of his children according to the flesh (Psalms 132:10-12 - 1 Kings 2:1-4 - 6:11-13 - 8:25 - 9:1-9 - 11:29-39 - 15:1-5 - 2 Chronicles 7:11-22 - 12:1-16 - 2 Kings 8:16-19 - 2 Chronicles 21). Thus the kingdom of Judah was destroyed because of the behavior of Manasseh who was a descendant of David (2 Kings 21:1-16 - 23:25-27 - 24:1-4 - 2 Chronicles 33:1-9 - Jeremiah 1:1-3 - 4:1-4,5-10 - 15:1-4,5-7 - 19:1-5,6-15 - 32:29-35), and it is in Jesus Christ that God the Father has fulfilled the promise made to David (Isaiah 9:6-7 - Luke 1:28-35 - 4 Rommel 6:44-48) concerning the inheritance of his own kingship (2 Samuel 7:16) and concerning the inheritance of the kingship of his immediate successor who was Solomon (1 Chronicles 17:14 – 22:6-13 - 28:1-10), because God fulfills all the words of the holy spirit. However our transgressions influence the nature of the tests undergone by our descendants according to the flesh but only for a few generations, and our obedience influences those tests for many generations (Exodus 34:5-7 - 1 Kings 21:20-29 - 2 Chronicles 32:23-26 - 2 Kings 10:9-11,28-31 - Jeremiah 16:1-4 - 32:17-19).
16 In addition, Moses established a temporary house of Yahweh in order to replace the idol that had just been made by the people who needed to observe what they worshiped so as not to go astray (Exodus 33:7-11). And at that time which preceded the tent of meeting built according to the model shown by God (Exodus 34:1-4,28-31,32-35 - Number 7:89 - 1 Rommel 3:42), Moses who is from the tribe of Levi and his servant Joshua who is from the tribe of Ephraim (Numbers 13:8,16) did not need to decorate their garments with noisy bells and several copies of the names of Jacob’s twelve sons to prove their closeness to God. And God was accessible to all when Moses had not yet gone to the mountain for the first time (Exodus 4:27-29 - 19:1-6 - 20:18-23 - 24:1-11,12-14 - 3 Rommel 1:2-3,10-12). [Moses and Joshua went there (Exodus 32:15-18) to receive the tablets of stone which were to contain the ten words that had been heard by the whole assembly (Exodus 20:22-23), and the explanations by examples on how to put them into practice (Deuteronomy 5:22-29,30-33) since God is only interested in the quality of intentions. God the holy spirit only wants to know why you are doing what you do and not what you are doing (3 Rommel 1:25 - 2:24-25 - 5 Rommel 7:3 - Proverbs 21:27 - 4 Rommel 1:8-9 - 8:13-15 - Numbers 7:1-9 - Exodus 21:28-29 - Job 32:1-3,4-10 - Malachi 1:14 - 4 Rommel 6:19), and that is why there is no contradiction between the first two of the ten commandments that God pronounced in the ears of all the people (Exodus 20:1-6) and the fact that God asked Moses to build a house of God in response to the sin of the people who wanted to make a god that they could see with their eyes while Moses was absent (Exodus 25:1-8 - 2 Chronicles 2:4-6 - 1 Rommel 3:22).] 
17 For every disobedience to the word of Yahweh receives a punishment (4 Rommel 3:12 - 7:33 - Proverbs 29:19), as with Saul the first king of Israel (1 Samuel 13:13-14 - 15:28-29 - Numbers 23:19 - 2 Rommel 5 - 3 Rommel 1:16). Furthermore, God has manifested his dissatisfaction with Balaam (Numbers 22:20-22,23-35 - 2 Peter 2:15-16) who had already received a clear response when he had consulted God for the first time (Numbers 22:5-13). For Balaam has offended God when he chose not to respond directly to the messengers who returned to him with exactly the same request, since he has desired to consult God a second time only because the messengers have offered him a greater reward (Numbers 22:14-17,18-19). And David the second king of Israel also gave an answer to each of the transgressions of his servant Joab (2 Samuel 2:17-28 - 3:26-29 - 18:1-5,9-14 - 19:9-14 - 20:1-10 - 1 Kings 2:5-6).
18 But any response must be proportional to the fault (Exodus 21:22-25 - because as far as intentions are concerned, it is already a guilt when two people quarrel in a way that could physically hurt each other or hurt a third person - Proverbs 20:3), and the nature of the response that each person gives to an offensive act will necessarily depend on the authority that this person has on the culprits from the point of view of the social organization which is established in the country at the time of the facts. So the response of an ordinary person may simply be to pass on information to authorities who have more power to exercise justice, or it may consist of distancing oneself in a certain way. Now Saul seems not to have wanted to offend other human beings by the transgressions that he committed before discovering David's existence. However he directly disobeyed God at a time when the exact identity of God was not yet known, and without there being any known precedent that could have inspired him to do so. Moreover David and Absalom and Joab and Amasa are from the same family (1 Chronicles 2:13-17) and the problems are complicated so much so that Joab did not wait for an official confrontation before taking revenge on Amasa, and Joab also acted in an inappropriate context regarding Abner, and he disobeyed not the spirit of Yahweh but the king regarding Absalom. So king David is not afraid of Joab as one might think, but only of the spirit of Yahweh because Joab had a motive each time (4 Rommel 10:21-24). And it happened to Joab as he had done to the others since he died for an indirect guilt, simply because of his connection with Adonijah, despite the fact that Adonijah alone created a second provocation against Solomon (1 Kings 1:5-8,39-43,49-53 - 2:12-34). And also Absalom the son of David had a motive to rebel against the king who did not react to the offense of Amnon. But Absalom did not seek to serve the spirit through his rebellion, but only to serve himself because he lied in order to make himself a place in the hearts of the children of Israel, and he was killed while hanging between the heaven and the earth. [And the king had not pursued Absalom to kill him but to punish him for having acted without his consent (2 Samuel 13:39)] 
19 And the punishment of David may seem unfair (2 Samuel 12:1-14 - Leviticus 19:20). However on the one hand he has respected the law of Moses on the state of uncleanness (2 Samuel 11:4 - Leviticus 15:25-28), and on the other hand Yahweh had warned the people that they were wrong to ask for a king with powers which are superior to those of an ordinary judge (2 Samuel 15:1-6) and which have not all been specified in this book (1 Samuel 8:9-19 - 10:24-25 - 2 Samuel 24:3-4 - 2 Kings 1:1-15 - 1 Kings 10:8-9). Moreover, he was forced by circumstances (Psalms 56:8) but David tested Yahweh (1 Samuel 27:1-4 - 28:1-2 - 29:1-11) and in response Yahweh also tested him (1 Samuel 30:1-8).
20 Thus the response of Elisha is excessive (2 Kings 2:9-10,23-25) like that of his master Elijah (2 Kings 1:9-15 - Luke 9:51-56). However Elisha is not the Christ as is the case with Jesus of Nazareth the Son of God (1 John 3:1-7), and God wants every normal human being to have something to reproach himself for (1 John 1:8-10 - 2 Kings 15:1-7,32-34 - 2 Chronicles 19:1-4 - 20:31-33 - 1 Kings 22:41-43 - 2 Kings 18:1-3 - 20:12-19 - 2 Chronicles 32:23-26 - 1 Rommel 3:7-9 - 4 Rommel 14:12). The time intervals between the different reported statements are not specified (Jeremiah 31:23-26,27-28), but it seems obvious that Jeremiah had gone astray (Jeremiah 1:1-5 - 15:18-21 - 20:14-18 - Isaiah 45:9-12). And Miriam the sister of Moses (Exodus 2:1-10 - 1 Chronicles 6:1-3) was a prophet (Exodus 15:20-21 - Micah 6:3-5 - 4 Rommel 4:8) but not like Moses, and she has sinned because she could not justify herself before Yahweh (Numbers 12). At the time of the judges when new generations were born to the people who had dispersed in different territories after having come out of the wilderness, Micah sinned if he did not have a publicly acceptable justification while he was taking money from his mother, but he did not sin in his search for the right way to serve Yahweh the God of Israel (Judges 17:1-5,6-13 - 3 Rommel 2:24-25). And Sarah the wife of Abraham has said a lie only because she was afraid, but she was not talking to an ordinary person (Genesis 18:9-15). And Gehazi the servant of Elisha has sinned because he could not justify his behavior in an acceptable way in a situation that required it (2 Kings 5:20-27). And Jehu king of Israel did what was asked of him concerning the legacy of Ahab king of Israel (2 Kings 9:1-10 - 10:28-31), but Jehu also attacked Ahaziah king of Judah and his family without being asked (2 Kings 10:12-14 - 2 Chronicles 22:7-9 - Hosea 1:1-5). It seems that the mother of Ahaziah was the daughter of Ahab king of Israel and therefore the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel (1 Kings 16:21-31 - 2 Kings 8:16-18,25-27 - 2 Chronicles 21:5-6 - 22:2-5), but Yahweh the holy spirit of Elohim cannot have wished for Jehu to destroy the line of succession of the sons of David since Yahweh were using them to transmit the personal legacy of David (2 Kings 8:19 - 11:1-3 - 2 Chronicles 21:7 - 22:10-12), but Elohim has allowed Jehu to destroy those who were accessible to him. At a time when the exact identity of God is still unknown (1 Rommel 1:34-36), Asa the king of Judah did not consult the priests of the tribe of Levi or the seers of Yahweh to find out whether he could use a potential enemy in order to get rid of the king of Israel who had come to war against him (2 Chronicles 16:1-14 - 1 Kings 15:9-14). Some of the descendants of David loved God with a perfect heart outside the period of their transgressions like David had done (1 Kings 15:5 - Psalms 51), namely Asa and Jehoshaphat and Hezekiah, but some others among those who were not particularly wicked did not have a perfect heart (2 Kings 12:1-2 - 14:1-3 - 2 Chronicles 24:1-2 - 25:1-2 - 26:4-5 - 27:1-2). Even Joshua the servant of Moses has not always been a saint (Numbers 11:24-29), and Nebuchadnezzar the great king has certainly offended the holy spirit of Elohim in the events described in Daniel 3. A king has an influence on the behavior of his population who have a duty to obey him, but the nature of the legacy that a person leaves on earth depends on his personal relationship with God (2 Chronicles 20:31-33 - 4 Rommel 2:26). But the apostle Peter did not sin when he denied three times that he knew Jesus (Luke 22:31-34,54-62 - John 13:36-38 - 18:15-27) since he tried to fulfill his promise (Luke 22:47-51 - John 18:1-11). 
21 So Aaron is not really guilty because he did not initiate and he did not approve this rebellion, for he even makes the people undress to perform this abomination (Exodus 32:21-25). But since he submitted to their idolatrous solicitation, then Aaron will continually bear the names of the tribes of Israel in the dress that represents his dignity: these names will be on two stones placed on his two shoulders, and also on twelve stones placed on his heart (Exodus 28:9-21,29-38 - 29:29-30). 
22 But it seems that God the Father anticipated Aaron’s contribution to the sin of the people, since Moses had received the commandments concerning the building of the tabernacle and the ridiculous garments of Aaron before going down from the mountain to see the transgression of the people. But we must think that the angel have adapted the words that he spoke to Moses according to the events that were taking place in the camp (Deuteronomy 9:7-13 - Psalms 40 - Jeremiah 7:21-24 - 18:1-10 - Ezekiel 20:1-26), since the Torah of Moses contains other commandments that were given to resolve in real time problems that arose circumstantially (Numbers 27:1-11 - 36:1-10). And it is also possible that Aaron already had a similar behavior in an event of lesser importance that was not mentioned, for everyone always acts according to one's own nature and what changes is the information available and understood and the accumulated experience (Jeremiah 24:1-10 - 29:1-20). Now the commandment on the sabbath day was given to all the people before their great transgression, and my argument is that the sabbath day was given so that an incarnation of the Christ of God (4 Rommel 2:62-65) would come to explain the full meaning of the ten commandments (Deuteronomy 4:9-13,14-19,20-24) and to demonstrate the power of the Holy Spirit (3 Rommel 2:12 - 4 Rommel 12:24-25) since God is not interested in what we do but only in why we do it. 
23 For no one through his behavior can ridicule the holy spirit without suffering serious consequences (Exodus 3:1-6 - 25:8-16,17-22 - 32:1-6 - 33:1-7 - 34:27-28 - 2 Samuel 6:1-2 - 1 Kings 8:9 - 2 Chronicles 5:10 - Numbers 7:89 - 15:37-41 - Deuteronomy 1:19-46 - 5:1-33 - 6:20-25 - Jeremiah 3:14-16 - Psalms 119:129-168). 
24 Yahweh is magnificent in holiness and worthy of praise, and the only thing that matters in his sight is the state of mind of each one (1 John 2:15-17). 
25 His angels did not only interact with the genealogy from Abraham (Numbers 22). And for the family of Jacob, they enunciated ordinances that have no use in themselves and that only allowed to probe the states of minds (Leviticus 27).
26 And the separation of the children of Jacob into paternal tribes evidences their connected but separate existence in eternal life (Numbers 2 - 1 Chronicles 7:1-5). However false problems were created at the same time, problems that only made sense in the particular context in which the characters were involved (Leviticus 25:1-10 - Numbers 36:1-5). 
27 For Jacob had twelve sons but the inheritance which he attributed to Joseph was divided into two parts, namely the first two children of Joseph who were Ephraim and Manasseh (Genesis 48:5-6). Thus the children of Israel are actually thirteen, and distinct blessings were pronounced by the patriarch Jacob for each of them. However Moses the man of God is born in the third generation according to his particular genealogy (Exodus 6:16-20) since people still live long enough in this period (Genesis 47:9,28 - 50:26 - Job 42:16-17). And Moses was ordered not to attribute a specific territory to the tribe of Levi (Deuteronomy 10:5-9 - 18:1-8), but only cities scattered in the territories of their brothers (Numbers 35:1-8). Thus the territory initially attributed to the children of Jacob was to be divided into twelve distinct parts. And Ezekiel pushed the logic of separating the people into twelve tribes to the extreme several centuries later, since he prophesied concerning the distribution of the promised land at a time when the children of Jacob had already largely been driven out of the promised land because of their multiple disobedience to the commandments given by Moses, and Ezekiel declared among other things that the possessions of the tribe of Levi will no longer be scattered among the possessions of the other tribes of Israel (Ezekiel 1:1-3 - 48:1-8,9-21,22-29 - John 4:22 - 1 Kings 22:1-23). 
28 Moreover, the ark of the covenant must not leave the most holy place of the tabernacle built by the orders of Moses because it is planned that Aaron and his descendants only approach it once a year (Leviticus 16:1-9,27-34). But necessarily this occurs when the tabernacle is dismantled and moved (Exodus 40:36-38 - Numbers 4:1-33,49 - 9:15-23 - Deuteronomy 1:32-33 - Numbers 33:1-49), and Yahweh has explicitly commanded that this object be taken for the destruction of Jericho (Joshua 6:1-20). Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to distinguish between approaching this object with the intention of moving it, and approaching it with the intention of using it to communicate with Yahweh. For before Yahweh himself created a precedent at Jericho, the ark of Yahweh could not be used outside its normal context. It did not move with all the other parts of the tabernacle to accompany the rebels and be established in the promised land (Numbers 14:40-45) as was later the case when crossing the Jordan.
29 Furthermore, the altar on which sacrifices are to be offered to Yahweh already exists (Exodus 40:16-17,28-29) and has already been dedicated (Numbers 7:1-3,10-17). However, in order to physically testify of an event that is not unimportant (as in Joshua 22), another altar of stones is set up on mount Ebal and the people has offered sacrifices and has rejoiced there (Deuteronomy 27:1-13 - Joshua 8:30-35). 
30 I have discovered what is done under the sun. I have searched and I have found, for what seems incomprehensible is the final state of the universe (1 Kings 3:5-12 - Ecclesiastes 1:1-2 - 8:16-17). And here is what is done under the sun where everything is vanity.
31 God the Father continually creates circumstances that have no real meaning except in the particular contexts of their existence, and his holy spirit (1 Rommel 1:37) continuously probes each person in a completely individual way (Proverbs 4:20-27) to give them different places in eternity (Numbers 32:1-23 - Judges 16:23-30 - Isaiah 42:8 - 48:11 - Exodus 34:14 - 1 Samuel 24:9-15 - 26:23 - 2 Kings 22:14-20 - 2 Chronicles 25:1-28 - 33:21-25 - 4 Rommel 9:3-5,6-10 - Isaiah 8:5-10 - 10:1-6,7-14,15-23 - Jeremiah 4:1-4,5-10 - 21:1-10,11-14 - 29:20-33 - 44:1-30 - Daniel 4:29-37 - 5:1-30 - Deuteronomy 1:34-40 - 19:16-21 - 4 Rommel 4:7). [The exact definition of eternal life was not known to the apostles (John 14:1-3,4-5), but Jesus made it understood that this eternal life exists among us in the world of the living (1 Samuel 28:19 - Luke 20:34-38 - John 11:23-26) and that in eternal life there is a hierarchy of information according to their practical usefulness (John 8:21-22 - 13:33-36 - 4 Rommel 1:24 - 2:26).]  
32 This allows me to affirm that although the action of making a burnt offering is a sin in itself like Abraham's act of sacrificing his son, the one who initiated this practice acted in a particular context in the presence of events that we do not know. And this person pleased God in this particular context, and he received a place in the genealogy of the knowledge of Jesus Christ. And what remains of his action is only all the influence it actually had in preparing the coming of the Son of God, and in understanding his message namely the definition of the concept of sin (1 Rommel 1:35-36). A sin is not in what a man is doing at any given time but only in the reasons why he is doing it, that is to say in the relationship between the hope that he has at the bottom of his heart and the totality of the information that he knows (3 Rommel 1:4-6 - 4 Rommel 10:1-5 - Isaiah 28:8-17 - Colossians 2:1-3 - John 9:39-41). For the only thing that God desire from a person is to always have the truth in the inner part (4 Rommel 1:8-9 - 8:13-15). In other words his intentions must be continuously PUBLICLY justifiable in his own eyes (4 Rommel 11:2-5), and he may sometimes be the only one to know a part of the information that determines his behavior (4 Rommel 3:2-4,11-12 - Proverbs 12:15 - 21:2). [Now Yahweh had preferred the fruit offering of Abel to animal offering of Cain (Genesis 4:1-7), and we know that he may have shown this preference in some way that was later described (2 Chronicles 7:1-3), and the tolerable practice of burnt offerings might have originated with Noah. For Noah had acted with good intentions to thank Yahweh (Genesis 8:14-21), based on his imperfect knowledge of the exact identity of Yahweh.]
33 Because of the precedent created by Yahweh who asked to use this object for the conquest of Jericho, the children of Israel brought the ark of the covenant to a battlefield when their hearts were far from the commandments of Yahweh and the ark was captured by the Philistines (1 Samuel 4). And the Philistines had problems with it for a few months (1 Samuel 5:9-12), and they sent it to a part of the territory of Israel that was not near the tent of meeting built by Moses. 
34 For the ark of God stayed for a very long time in the house of Abinadab (1 Samuel 7:1-2) when a first king had not yet been established by the prophet Samuel who is from the tribe of Ephraim (1 Samuel 1:1-2 - 8:1-9). And it is David the second king of Israel who brought back this ark of God under a new tent which he built near his own house (2 Samuel 6 - 1 Chronicles 13:1-14 - 15:1-3,11-14,25-29). And this house of David was in the city of David, and the city of David was a part of the mount Zion which is in Jerusalem (2 Samuel 5:4-11 - 6:12-16 - 24:18-25 - 2 Chronicles 3:1). [And Abinadab was not a Levite (2 Samuel 6:1-4 - 1 Chronicles 15:1-3,11-14)]
35 Unlike the Passover whose accomplishment by the people is mentioned at least four times (Exodus 12:42-51 - Leviticus 23:4-6 - Numbers 9:1-14 - 2 Kings 23:21-23 - 2 Chronicles 30:1-20,21-27 - 35:1-19 - Ezra 6:15-22), we notice that the normal use of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh (Exodus 30:10 - Leviticus 16:1-10,26-28,29-34 - 23:23-32) has never been mentioned. Nothing is said about it when the most significant and joyous event in the entire existence of the kingdom of Israel is described, at the time when it is told how Solomon moved the ark from the tent that his father David had set up for it, in order to place it in the house that he had just built for the name of Yahweh the God of Israel (1 Kings 8:1-3 - 2 Chronicles 5:1-4). And yet the feast of tabernacles has been mentioned for this event and it takes place a few days after the day of reconciliation (Leviticus 23:33-39 - 1 Kings 8:65-66 - 2 Chronicles 7:8-10). And the day of reconciliation was not mentioned when the families of Judah and Israel (2 Chronicles 11:1-12,13-17 - 15:8-9) returned from the captivity in order to rebuild the house of Yahweh (Ezra 3:1-6), nor when the walls of Jerusalem had been rebuilt by [the leadership of] Nehemiah (Nehemiah 7:73 - 8:13-18). The ark of the covenant had certainly been taken up and hidden before the servants of Nebuchadnezzar began to carry the precious objects of the house of God built by Solomon to Babylon (Jeremiah 25:1 - Daniel 1:1-2 - 2 Kings 24:1-7,8-17 - 2 Chronicles 36:5-10), and to destroy that house (2 Kings 25:1-12,13-21). For it was not part of the precious objects that were given back to the populations who were returning from captivity (Ezra 1). It seems necessary to think that the day of reconciliation was not mentioned at Solomon's inauguration of the temple because of the joyous nature of the event, which contrasted with the sadness that is necessary on the day of reconciliation. And it must be thought that it was because of the absence of the ark of the covenant that the tenth day of the seventh month lost its significance from the time when the house of Yahweh was destroyed and after the return of the captives from Babylon, since the people chose to simply humiliate their souls on the twenty fourth day of that seven month (Nehemiah 9:1-6,36-38 - and it seems necessary to think that this humiliation of their souls was initiated after the destruction of the temple of Yahweh and has continued over time out of habit and because of the absence of the ark of the covenant - 2 Kings 25:8-10 - 2 Chronicles 36:21-23 - Zechariah 7:1-5), and we note that the priest Ezra who was a specialist in the law of Moses and who arrived in Jerusalem after the building of the house of Yahweh (Ezra 6:15-16 - 7:1-5,6-10 - Nehemiah 8:1-12) has not been cited among those who participated to that event (Nehemiah 9:1-6,36-38 - 10:1-27,28-34). And if none of the ordinary accomplishment of the day of reconciliation has been mentioned somewhere, a day of organized sadness which was not the consequence of a guilt identifiable by the people in those days, it is because the spirit of Yahweh does not flourish in sadness (Zechariah 8:19 - Philippians 4:4 - 1 Thessalonians 5:16 - It is not about laughing stupidly all the time, but it is just about not being sad or do anything without a motivation that is pleasant to the holy spirit. For one cannot repent of an inappropriate behavior without being sad - Psalms 51:17 - Ecclesiastes 7:1-4) and because the rituals requested by the law for this day of reconciliation only described the nature of the Christ of God who was to die for the sins of Israel and who also was to remain alive for eternity. [Those sins of Israel are committed through the existence of a house of Yahweh that has operating laws established by a law.] 
36 And David even created something new (2 Chronicles 28:22-25 - 29:1-8,25-28) by asking the Levites to sing before the ark of Yahweh (1 Chronicles 16:1-7,37-38), while the tabernacle built by Moses continues to be used in another place to perform the other rituals which were prescribed by Moses and which also provide the tribe of Levi with its livelihood (1 Samuel 10:3 - 1 Chronicles 16:39-40 - 21:28-30 - 1 Kings 3:1-5,15 - 2 Chronicles 1:1-7 - 3 Rommel 1:40-41 - 4 Rommel 7:13-20). [And even prophets who are not members of the tribe of Levi may sometimes have needs (1 Samuel 9:5-10 - 1 Kings 14:1-3), because in reality no one does anything for nothing (1 Kings 5:1-12 - 2 Chronicles 2:1-12) even if in certain situations it is possible to seek only a moral satisfaction (Nehemiah 5). And all those who are willing to repair the house of God do not necessarily have the resources to offer something, therefore some must be paid for their work (2 Kings 12:1-16 - 2 Chronicles 24:1-18)] 
37 For the strict application of the commandments of Moses can remain unchanged if the ark of the covenant [whose ordinary use only takes place once a year] is the only element to be separated from the tabernacle which also contains the altar of incense (Exodus 30:1-10 - 40:26) and the altar of burnt offerings (Exodus 27:1-8 - 40:29) and others things (Exodus 40:1-11 - 27:9-21). For God speaks even without the intermediary of the ark of the covenant (Genesis 6:5-13 - 15:1 - 20:3 - 46:1-4 - 48:1-4 - Exodus 3:1-6 - 4:27-29 - 25:21-22 - Numbers 22:5-13 - 24:1-4 - Judges 6:7-10 - 1 Samuel 2:27-30 - 2 Chronicles 7:11-12 - 1 Kings 3:5,15 - 19:1-15 - Amos 7:10-15 - Daniel 9:17-23 - Ezra 5:1-2 - Haggai 1:12-15 - 2:1-5,10-15,20-23 - Acts 10:1-8,9-20 - 3 Rommel 1:22). 
38 However, there may have been logistical problems even before the people dispersed and multiplied after leaving the wilderness (Deuteronomy 12:8-14,19-28). As a result, at some unspecified time and after some moving of the sanctuary of Yahweh, a larger structure called the temple of God was built at Shiloh to contain the tabernacle of Moses (1 Samuel 3:3,15 - Jeremiah 7:9-15). 
39 This is certain because Samuel is not from the tribe of Levi (1 Samuel 1) as it is the case for many judges who are either established by the people (Exodus 18:13-27 - Deuteronomy 16:18-20 - 17:8-13 - 1 Samuel 8:1-5) to solve problems between the persons in the land (4 Rommel 12:62-65), or chosen by the angels of Yahweh to be leaders in liberating the people from the oppression of a foreign nation (Judges 4:4-5 - 10:1-18 - 13:1-5 - 1 Samuel 3:19-21 - 7:1-4,13-17 - 12:17,23). And the descendants of Aaron are the only ones authorized to touch the holy things of the sanctuary of Yahweh (Numbers 4:15-20 - 18:1-20), and the other descendants of the tribe of Levi are the only ones authorized to serve in the borders closest to the sanctuary (Numbers 3:1-10 - 18:21-32 - 1 Chronicles 15:2). 
40 It is also certain that the tabernacle was moving before and after Joshua's death (4 Rommel 12:18). For the next generations may have dedicated different places to Yahweh (1 Samuel 10:3 - 1 Kings 3:2-4), but Joshua was not able to do so (Joshua 1:7-9 - 8:30-35 - 22:16-18 - 18:1-3 - 24:1,25-28 - Judges 2:6-11). And after the death of Joshua, before a larger structure was designed to house it at Shiloh, the sanctuary of Yahweh has been located in Bethel (Judges 20:26-28 - 21:19) but at a time that cannot be determined. 
41 Indeed, all the stories are not in chronological order because there seems to be a thematic insertion in Joshua (Joshua 15:13-19 - Judges 1:1,10-15), and also in Judges and elsewhere (Judges 2:8 - 2 Kings 13:9-15 - 1 Chronicles 6:14-15 - 10:1-2), and in Jeremiah (2 Chronicles 36:1-12 - Jeremiah 21:1-2 - 24:1 - 25:1 - 32:1-3 - 36:1 - 37:1-4 - And it is evident that Jeremiah 42:19-22 occurred before Jeremiah 43:1-4 when we read Jeremiah 42-43), and also in the comparison of the order of identical events which are presented with sometimes some different details in the books of Samuel and in the book 1 Chronicles, but the chronology is very often clearly followed according to the content. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron is still alive during the events described at the end of the book of Judges (Joshua 22:13 - 24:33 - Judges 20:27-28) while the last judges lived more than three hundred years after the death of Joshua (Judges 11:26 - 12:7-15 - 13:1 - 16:30-31). Thus, the last five chapters of the book of Judges occurred after the death of Joshua but at a time period that cannot be determined.
42 The chronology of events is sometimes evident in the writings of Moses and the stages of the journey are clearly specified in the chapter thirty three of the book of Numbers, but there are thematic groupings (Numbers 1:1 - 9:1 - Exodus 40:8-17 - Numbers 7:1-2,10-11 - 1 Rommel 2:7). And this also concerns the end of the book of Exodus. Indeed there is only one ark of the covenant (Number 14:44) and it was available before Moses had received the tablets of stone for the second time according to the summary made in the book of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 10:1-5). But this event is described in chapter thirty four of the book of the exodus (Exodus 34:1,29) and nevertheless the actual construction of the various objects by the instructions of Moses is recounted from chapter thirty five of the exodus (Exodus 31:1-11 - 38:22 - 39:42-43 - 40:16-17). 
43 It is always natural phenomena that are used to achieve all wonders (Exodus 14:21 - Numbers 11:7-9,31-32) and even Moses seems to be aware of it (Numbers 11:21-23) but their identities are not always specified and the real physical link between each living being and all of its achievements in the world is not an easy dimension to manipulate. 
44 The objective of the bible is to allow a good understanding of the concept of the holy spirit, and the words of the holy spirit ignite the heart and bones of each person (Jeremiah 23:28-29 - Luke 3:15-16) because they all describe a single fundamental truth that it is foolish to hope to refute (4 Rommel 4:3-4 - 14:1-4,10-11). Therefore the importance of the rigor of any particular detail in a story depends only on the useful information that the reader is supposed to extract from this story (Ecclesiastes 12:10-14). Therefore it seems necessary to me to delete the following verses from the Bible: Job 15:28-29 - 2 Kings 13:23 - 24:13b - 1 Chronicles 7:24-29 - Psalms 10:8-11 - 44:20-26 - 55 - 68 - 69:35-36 - 87 - 88 - 102 - 107 - 119:79 - 127 - 128 - 129 - 141 - Proverbs 16:31 - 17:8,16 - 18:18 - 19:10,24 - 20:21,30 - 21:20 - 22:29 - 23:23 - 25:15,25-28 - 26:15 - 27:10-11,18-19,23-27 - Ecclesiastes 4:13-16 - Isaiah 11:14-16 - 13–14 - 17–19 - 23–27 - 30:22-33 - 31–35 - 46–47 - 49 - 60 - 62–64 - 66:12-24 - Jeremiah 3:17-25 - 17:19-27 - 25:13-38 - 30:16 - 31:38-40 - 33:14-26 - 46–51 - Lamentations 1–2,4–5 - Ezekiel 7 - 15 - 19 - 21–23 - 25–32 - 35–36 - 38–39 - Daniel 8 - 11 - 12:11-13 - Hosea 7–10 - Joel 1:17-20 - 2:20 - 3 - Obadiah - Micah 2–3 - 5:5-6 - Nahum - Zephaniah - Habakkuk 3 - Zechariah 9–11 - Luke 8:56 - 22:19-20,30,43-44 - John 7:53 - 12:14b-16 - 16:5b - Acts 18:18b - 27:9b. [Now I reject John 12:14b-16 because the content of Zechariah 9 from which that reference comes seems very suspect to me, and I reject John 16:5b because of John 13:36-37 - 14:4-9. Moreover, Luke 22:19-20 can be found in one of the Epistles of Paul but it is not part of the Gospel. Likewise, water baptism in the name of Jesus is a practice found only in the Acts of the Apostles and in the writings of the apostle Paul, and its origin according to the Bible is found in the practice of John the Baptist who has taught the renunciation of evil works but has not revealed the exact identity of the God of Israel because he did not know it (4 Rommel 6:39-43). Now the apostle Paul intends to create a form of school to perpetuate the message of Jesus (4 Rommel 6:33-35 - 11:22) so that it may not be easily forgotten in all future generations who will certainly transgress in different ways as it has been since the beginning of the history of the chosen people (Judges 2:7-11 - John 2:23-25), and water baptism is not part of the gospel since the only thing that Jesus commanded his apostles was to ensure that the good news could be continually proclaimed to everyone (John 20:30-31 - 21:14-17 - Luke 24:45-49 - Acts 1:1-5,6-8 - 2 Thessalonians 3:1-5,6-16 - Philippians 4:8-9).] 
45 It is extraordinary that there is practically no theological waste in the whole history part (Genesis - Job - Exodus - Leviticus - Numbers - Deuteronomy - Joshua - Judges - Ruth - 1 Samuel - 2 Samuel - 1 Kings - 2 Kings - 1 Chronicles - 2 Chronicles - Ezra - Nehemiah - Esther) and in the revelation of the identity of God (Luke - John - Acts - Paul - Peter - First John). How can one not believe in Yahweh when one sees that all these books teach a single message (1 Rommel 3:2) which is the definition of eternal life and the only way to make a comfortable place in it. All this is too sophisticated and it benefits no one in particular, absolutely no one: # The desire to immortalize the significant events that precede and coexist with the introduction of the notion of the house of God (Exodus 17:13-15 - 24:1-4,5-7 - 1 Rommel 3:29 - 3 Rommel 1:31 - Joshua 3:7-17 - 4:1-9,10-19,20-24 - Judges 6:11-24 - 1 Samuel 7:15-17 - Esther 9:20-32). # The system of offerings established for such a house and the possibility for foreigners to convert (4 Rommel 6:30-32 - 7:10-12,13-20). And the distinction between voluntary and involuntary transgression is supposed to continue to exist when the temple of Ezekiel will be built, but a different ritual will be required for involuntary transgressions that concern the particular rituals that are required in the written law (4 Rommel 7:18-19) and there will be differences for all the obligatory offerings that will be offered to Yahweh alone (4 Rommel 7:21-24 - Micah 6:6-8 - Psalms 50:1-15,16-23 - John 1:17-18). # On the one hand the priests could be any persons before the law of Moses (5 Rommel 9:17), and there was an establishment of a temporary house of Yahweh immediately after the people had offended Yahweh by the golden calf that they forced Aaron to make, and this temporary house of Yahweh was not subject to the law that Moses will give later since Joshua who is from the tribe of Ephraim had access to it (1 Rommel 3:16). On the other hand, after Moses had built a house for Yahweh and had given in writing the laws of its functioning, the priests are only male descendants of Aaron (1 Rommel 3:12), a privileged family within the entire tribe of Levi who must serve in the house of Yahweh as a reward for the particular behavior of their fathers (1 Rommel 3:14 - Malachi 2:1-3,4-7 - 1 Rommel 3:20). # The distinction between the priests and the prophets, because priests are established by their genealogy and are male while prophets can be any person (1 Rommel 3:11). # The revelation of Jesus Christ who justifies the fact that punishments and promises have always been individual and have sometimes been declared for events that can occur after the death of the persons concerned (3 Rommel 2:22-23 - 4 Rommel 12:5-9). # On the one hand the definition of eternal life can be formulated mathematically and independently, and reveals a triune nature of God (4 Rommel 1:1-12 - 2:62-65 - 14:1-4), and on the other hand this triune nature is found in the introduction of the Gospel according to John and in his epistle, and also in the epistles of Paul who teaches that Jesus Christ has put an end to the law of Moses (Romans 10:4) and that the holy spirit is the true God who must dwell in our bodies (Ephesians 2:20-22 - 3 Rommel 1:16-18,28-30), and also in the structure of the entire Hebrew Bible (3 Rommel 1:2-3 - 4 Rommel 4:5-6) in which no one can see God and live (Exodus 33:18-23 - John 1:18) and yet ordinary people have seen God (Genesis 32:24-30 - Exodus 24:9-12). # We can add to this the fact that what is designated by the word God in the modern translations of the Old Testament is a translation of the word Elohim of the ancient Hebrew which is by definition a plural word designating a group of divinities. The holy one of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob is the holy spirit of Elohim, and Elohim is the one who causes all things to happen, but the holy one of Jacob has asked to be called Yahweh and has imposed the trinity in his holy scriptures by saying that he himself is Elohim and the only Elohim (Deuteronomy 4:39). I think that this link is at the origin of the expression 'I, even I' that we often find in certain translations (which claim to be word for word translations like the King James Version 1611) and that I may not have reproduced identically each time (Deuteronomy 32:39 - Isaiah 43:11,25 - 45:12). It is a revelation of the identity between two beings who are a priori different, on the one hand there is Elohim who acts on everything that exists and on the other hand there is his holy spirit who can only exist within living beings, and it is not mathematically trivial to represent (Ephesians 4:6). [And Ezekiel has a special way of making us understand that identical things can be called by different names (Ezekiel 45:10-14)]. # And between the groups of books mentioned above, there is a perfect transition made by Isaiah and Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Daniel. All that I have preserved from the book of Isaiah is more than poetry, and all that I have preserved from the book of Jeremiah does not resemble a fiction, and all that I have preserved from the book of Ezekiel is too precise, and all that I have preserved from the book of Daniel demonstrates with greater clarity that the one who causes all things to happen does not use genealogy as a criterion for distributing roles to different persons, and the chapters three and four and six of the book of Daniel encourage the rejection of atheism. One can feel much authenticity in what I have preserved of these four books (Isaiah 40 - Jeremiah 28 - Ezekiel 33 - Daniel 9:2-24), and their coherence with the two groups of books mentioned above is of a mathematical precision, and the unique message that is conveyed can be conceived in an independent way. # And the conclusions that I have established in this document had been understood not in detail but in a global way by Justin Martyr who is said to be one of the first Christian philosophers, and who is convinced of the veracity of the Hebrew Bible and of the final character of the revelation of Jesus Christ who did not impose the creation of assemblies whose sole purpose is to worship him (3 Rommel 1:46-47,48-50), and his ideas are similar to those of the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria and of the early Christian scholar Origen of Alexandria. And even the scientists of the sixteenth century thought that the early Christians were not completely insane people, such as the astronomer Johannes Kepler who supposedly sought a description of the trinity of God by the objects of the physical world and who wrote, 'I wanted to become a theologian. For a long time I was restless. Now, however, behold how through my effort God s being celebrated in astronomy', or the mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton who said the following thing, 'I have a fundamental belief in the Bible as the Word of God, written by men who were inspired. I study the Bible daily'. And who can invent the five books of the Torah of Moses, and the book of the Gospel of John whose words are disconcertingly clear (4 Rommel 4:3-4 - 11:24-25 - John 13:21-29 - Luke 9:44-45 - 18:31-34) and which seem to be the only possible source of other completely senseless words (4 Rommel 2:32-34), their perfect coherence and the absence of theological errors, and the letters of Paul and Peter, and the first letter of John, to describe a God who created everything and who gave birth to his only begotten Son at a certain moment in the history of humanity, in order to sacrifice him within the framework of a pedagogical law previously given to certain people and thus save humanity from something that no one can understand (Genesis 49:10 - John 3:16 - 1 Rommel 1:38). 
46 Now I have changed the number of years in 2 Kings 15:1 to match the exact length of the reign of Amaziah king of Judah, with a maximum margin of one year (1 Rommel 2:8), and I have also changed the length of the reign of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel in 2 Kings 14:23 to match the length of reign given in 2 Kings 15:8. And I have changed the name and the number of years in 2 Kings 15:30, and the number of years in 2 Kings 15:32, and I have done it by observing 2 Kings 16:1 and Isaiah 7:1-4 and even the whole chronology of the book 2 Kings. I have also modified the name and date in Jeremiah 27:1 by observing Jeremiah 27:3,20 and Jeremiah 28:1, and the number of years in 2 Kings 3:1 by observing 1 Kings 16:29 - 22:41-42 and 2 Kings 1:17 and 2 Kings 8:16. Another modification that I have made concerns the ark of the covenant, the mention of which is superfluous in Judges 20:26-28 and 2 Samuel 11:11, and it cannot appear in 1 Samuel 14:18 since it is rather the ephod which is used to consult the word of Yahweh (1 Samuel 14:3 - 23:6 - 28:6 - Numbers 27:18-23). And I think that all these verses are voluntary falsifications because there are indications each time for a coherent correction, and therefore the authors of these alterations seem to have said in their hearts, 'Forgive us for making this falsification, O Yahweh, because it is so that those who had loved what they knew of you before Jesus will not be completely destroyed by your true followers'. This is why I think that king Darius who appears in Daniel 6 is the same as the one who appears in Ezra 4–6, by making the connection between Esther 1:18-19 - 8:7-8 and Daniel 6:8-9,14-15, and that it is another king who should appear at the beginning of Daniel 9 because it is not necessary that the whole book of Daniel should preserve the chronological order that is apparent in its first five chapters (1 Rommel 3:41). And also the number of years in Haggai 2:10 because it seems obvious to me that the events of chapter two of the book of Haggai have taken place after the events of Ezra 4–6, and it is completely obvious that the names which appear in Zechariah 6:10 must be the same as those which appear in Zechariah 6:14, and the number of years in 1 Chronicles 23:3 must be the same as that in 1 Chronicles 23:27, and I have reduced by fifty thousand the number of dead concerning those who looked into the ark of the covenant (1 Samuel 6:19). I think these are the only significant changes that I have made in the whole history part (Genesis - Job - Exodus - Leviticus - Numbers - Deuteronomy - Joshua - Judges - Ruth - 1 Samuel - 2 Samuel - 1 Kings - 2 Kings - 1 Chronicles - 2 Chronicles - Ezra - Nehemiah - Esther), because I have only made clarifications regarding the meaning of words in other verses of those books like in Exodus 22:18. But all this is not of the greatest importance because the teaching that I transmit remains unchanged if we decided to suppress in this biblical presentation all the extracts that cannot be based solely on the Torah of Moses (Genesis - Exodus - Leviticus - Numbers - Deuteronomy), or even any extract that is based on any book. For any Bible could be indefinitely completed if it were possible to have reasons to believe in the authenticity of the stories (John 20:30-31 - Ecclesiastes 12:10-14), and I assure the reader that all that I have retained is more than sufficient for a complete understanding of the behavior of a God who can be defined in an independent way. Now concerning the book of Isaiah, it is said at the introduction of his book that he is a contemporary of king Hezekiah, and it is a lie to say that Babylon, which he mentioned in Isaiah 21, was punished for striking the kingdom of Judah. For this is not the reasoning that is expounded in the books of kings and of Chronicles (2 Kings 24:8-20 - 2 Chronicles 36:1-10,11-13,14-17), and it is not what is taught by the prophets Jeremiah (Jeremiah 27:1-22 - 29:1-7,8-13,14-20 - 43:1-13 - 52:1-3), and Daniel (Daniel 2:26-46 - 4:29-37 - 5:1-30), and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1:1-3 - 17:12-21 - 24:1-27 - 2 Rommel 21-24), and by the apostle Paul (Ephesians 3), and we see similarities in the prophecies of Yahweh (Genesis 15:13-16 - Jeremiah 25:9-12). In addition, not only the message transmitted by Isaiah is unique like that of the whole Bible, but his style, which is the style of Yahweh (Jeremiah 2), is so particular that it seems unfair to designate him as the author of some poems of poor quality. I may be wrong (5 Rommel 2:27) but concerning some of the chapters that I have rejected, it seems to me that the falsifiers have used the words of the prophet which are already very often repeated, and have made harmonious groupings in order to suggest a different biblical message.
47 The major prophets are those who have explicitly announced that there is something greater than the law of Moses, concerning the duty of mankind toward the creator of all things. These announcements are in Isaiah, and in Jeremiah, and in Ezekiel, and in Daniel, and in Daniel we see that it is not the genealogy that concerns the creator of all things (Daniel 1–2), and the eternal king is announced a second time (Daniel 7), and it is an indirect announcement that is made in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:15-28 - 48:29-35). For the writings of Ezekiel make us think about the usefulness of a house of God that is built by human hands, about the usefulness of all that is obligatory in such a house. More specifically, it is necessary to consider on the one hand the exact plans of construction of such a house (Exodus 19:9,17 - 24:9-12 - 29:38-42,43-46 - Numbers 35:34 - Ezekiel 1:1-28 - 3:14-15,22-24 - 8:1-4,5-6 - 10:1-4,15-22 - 11:1-13,22-25 - 40:1-5 - 43:1-4,5-12 - 44:1-5 - 48:29-35 - It can be noted that the destruction of Jerusalem by the sword was seen by Ezekiel during the sixth year in Ezekiel 9:1-11 and could only have occurred during the eleventh year, the number of years of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah the son of Jehoiakim with a large part of the nobles of Judah, and also the number of years of the reign of Zedekiah the last king of Judah. And the events that were shown to Ezekiel in the vision on that day were not ordered according to their chronology since it seems that Jerusalem was not yet destroyed in Ezekiel 11. Now I have selected and arranged the preceding excerpts from the books of Exodus and Numbers and Ezekiel to illustrate the Jewish thought according to which Yahweh needs a house to dwell in - 1 Kings 8:9 - 2 Chronicles 5:10 - Numbers 10:29-33 - Haggai 1:12-15 - 2:1-5,10-15,20-23 - Zechariah 2:10-13 - 8:1-3 - 3 Rommel 1:2 - 5 Rommel 5:10-12 - John 10:30-31 - Acts 7:46-54,55-60 - 1 Rommel 3:35), because Moses specified other plans with the description of construction materials in the written law (Exodus 25–27), and on the other hand it is necessary to think about the quantities and qualities of the things that are offered Yahweh alone on dates that the written law of Moses have fixed in advance (4 Rommel 13 - Micah 6:6-8 - Psalms 50:1-15,16-23 - John 1:17-18). It has been said somewhere about the scriptures of the Hebrew Bible that one should read David [who is the author of the majority of psalms] for piety, and Isaiah for consolation, and Jeremiah for punishment, and Ezekiel for wisdom [and I add Daniel for understanding]. Now each of these authors makes us feel all these emotions, but with a particular emphasis on his specialty.
48 And I advise against trying to understand the exact structure of the temple described by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 40:4-49 - 41–42 - 43:13-17 - 45:1-8 - 48:8-22) because it does not have the same simplicity as the written description of the tabernacle of Moses, and it is a total waste of time since the useful teaching is found in the comparison between its laws of operation and the laws of operation of the tabernacle of Moses which had been preserved in the house built by the initiative of David. And I even think that not dwelling on this aspect is part of the wisdom contained in Ezekiel [even if there can be no internal contradiction in his writings], because logically this description must have been designed to be unintelligible since the Gospel of Jesus Christ teaches that this eternal house is not supposed to exist (2 Rommel 23-24). However there is a continuity between the temple built by Solomon and the description given by Ezekiel, concerning the central house which consists of the holy place and of the most holy place (1 Kings 6:2-3,16-20 - 2 Chronicles 3:3-4,7-8 - Ezekiel 41:1-4) and which is surrounded by rooms built on three floors (1 Kings 6:4-6,7-10 - Ezekiel 41:5-7 - These additional rooms that are different from the holy place and the most holy place do not exist in the tabernacle built by Moses according to the model that he saw in a vision - Exodus 25:9,40 - 26:30 - and it is king David who wanted the ark of Yahweh to dwell in a more comfortable structure whose plans were then described to him by the spirit of Yahweh - 1 Chronicles 28:1-7,12-19), and concerning the idea that priests should not wear sacred garments when they are near the people (Leviticus 16:1-4,20-24), and in the temple of Ezekiel this happens when the priests leave the inner courtyard of the sanctuary to go into the outer courtyard of the sanctuary (Ezekiel 42:13-14 - 44:17-19).
49 There is a remarkable information in the writings of Ezekiel. It is a notion of trinity in the person of a prince who will behave like a king because he will lead the people, and like a high priest because he will receive the offerings of the people and will give himself all that will be necessary to give to Yahweh, and like God because he will be the only one authorized to enter and exit through a door through which the glory of Yahweh has entered. Indeed, in the writings of Moses the people can choose a king who has the function of directing the activities of the social life of the people (Deuteronomy 17:14-20), but it is not an obligation. And after the people have transgressed the covenant of the ten words that Yahweh made with them shortly after their arrival in the wilderness of Sinai, there will be the establishment of a temporary house of Yahweh which was not subject to precise laws and which was accessible only to Moses and Joshua who are the two people absent during the transgression of the people (1 Rommel 3:16). And then there was the actual construction of the sanctuary which will be subject to all the strange laws that Yahweh gave to Moses (1 Rommel 3:22), and which will be the visible testimony of the covenant between Yahweh and his people since it is there that the two stone tablets containing the ten words of the covenant will be kept in an ark that must be placed inside the most holy place (1 Rommel 3:28). And this sanctuary is also the place where children of Israel are supposed to offer to Yahweh gifts that one wants to offer only to Yahweh alone, like the burnt offerings on the altar of sacrifices which must be located outside the house made of the holy place and of the most holy place (Deuteronomy 12:10-12,13-14,17-19), and like the pleasant smell of the incense burned by a priest on the unique altar of perfumes which must be located inside the holy place in front of the most holy place (1 Rommel 3:37). And the sanctuary is the place of service of the whole tribe of Levi which contains the priests who are the descendants of Aaron (Numbers 16–17). But Yahweh can express himself through prophets who can be ordinary people while the high priest who is a descendant of Aaron is the supreme intermediary between Yahweh and men since he is the one who has the last word in all controversies if the people has not established a king (3 Rommel 1:22). And after the death of Moses the people entered the promised land under the leadership of Joshua, and the people lived for more than three hundred years without establishing a king during the entire period described in the books of Joshua and Judges and Ruth (Judges 11:26), and it is the prophet Samuel who will establish a first king over Israel because of the people who has demanded the establishment of such a king (1 Samuel 8:1-9 - 12:6-12,13-15), and Saul the first king of Israel does not really fear Yahweh according to the information at his disposal (1 Rommel 3:17) therefore Yahweh will not offer him a legacy that shines above all others, and David the second king of Israel has the fear of Yahweh according to the information at his disposal (1 Samuel 24:9-15 - 26:7-12 - 1 Rommel 3:19) therefore Yahweh promises to offer him a legacy that will shine above all others. And the sin of Solomon the son of David caused the division of the kingdom of Israel into two separate kingdoms. For in the old age of Solomon, his many foreign wives caused him to have doubts about how he was supposed to serve Yahweh, Yahweh being the God of all flesh who had prophets even outside the tribes of Israel like Balaam and Job. And during the whole existence of the kingdoms of the children of Israel, each king has created his own legacy according to his desire to obey the will of Yahweh of which he had knowledge, and the many transgressions of the people led to the destruction of each of the two kingdoms of the children of Jacob and the departure of a large part of the people into captivity, and even of all the people as far as the land of Judah was concerned (Jeremiah 40-41). And Ezekiel has prophesied while being among one of the company that was taken captive from the land of Judah before the destruction of Jerusalem, and Ezekiel announces that certain captives will return to the promised land after a certain time and will form one kingdom (Ezekiel 37:21-22), and that there will be one king who will be their prince forever (Ezekiel 37:23-25), and that the sanctuary of Yahweh will be in the midst of the people forever (Ezekiel 37:26-28). And when Ezekiel describes his concept of sanctuary at the end of his book (Ezekiel 40-48), we see that the prince will not be one of the priests (Ezekiel 45:1-5,6-9 - 46:1-3), and the prince will have powers different from those who were kings over the families of Jacob's children in the past (Ezekiel 46:8-10,16-18), and the prince will be the only person of the people who is not a priest and who can enter the inner courtyard (Ezekiel 44:17-19 - 46:1-3), and the prince will serve as an intermediary between Yahweh and men (Ezekiel 45:13-15,16-17,21-22). Now all the buildings of the sanctuary are inside a great wall which has gates to the east and to the north and to the south, and maybe elsewhere, and the east gate must remain closed because the glory of Yahweh has entered the sanctuary through it (Ezekiel 43:1-4 - 44:1-2) [and this makes it clear that the glory of Yahweh will never enter through any other of the gates to enter the outer courtyard of the sanctuary because otherwise it will be necessary to close that gate also, and then the people will no longer be able to access the sanctuary and to leave it (Ezechiel 46:8-10). History does not say what exactly happened after the glory of Yahweh entered through the eastern gate of the outer courtyard, and one does not know how this glory which was capable of rising into the air (Ezekiel 1:19-21 - 10:15-20 - 43:2-3) has done to cross the inner courtyard and thus access the holy place and the most holy place. Perhaps the glory of Yahweh has entered through the southern gate of the inner courtyard about which nothing has been said (Ezekiel 40:27-28,32 - 44:17-19 - 46:1-3)]. But the prince will sit before this particular gate to eat, and he will enter by the way of the porch of that gate and will leave by the same way (Ezekiel 44:3 - 46:8), and that gate through which the glory of Yahweh entered and that must remain closed will nevertheless be opened to the prince whenever the prince intends to make a freewill offering to Yahweh (Ezekiel 46:12). Moreover the prophet Zechariah spoke during the reconstruction of the temple of Yahweh by the people who returned from the captivity of Babylon and from elsewhere (Ezra 3:8-9 - 5:1-2 - Haggai 1:1-4 - Zechariah 4:6-10), and during this reconstruction Zechariah has announced the existence of another temple that will be built by a person called Branch (Zechariah 3:8-10 - 6:9-13,14-15 - 4 Rommel 12:59). Now the Gospel teaches that this prince who is to be king forever is Jesus Christ (Zechariah 2:10-11 - 3 Rommel 2:12), and he is also high priest because he is the only intermediary between God and men, and his followers form the true temple within which Yahweh the holy spirit of Elohim dwells, and this true temple is the body of Jesus Christ according to the fact that Jesus is alive and therefore he is the head of his church (3 Rommel 2:17 - Acts 20:24-28,29-35 - Ephesians 2:20-22). Yahweh wanted Ezekiel to speak with parables (Ezekiel 17:1-24 - 20:45-49 - 4 Rommel 8:15) and the waters of life that will come out from in front of the main house of the sanctuary near the altar, and that will come out of the whole borders of the sanctuary by the outer gate of the east which is the gate that must not be opened because the glory of Yahweh has entered through there, these waters of life are the exact understanding of the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Ezekiel 47:1-12 - John 4:1-15,16-22,23-24 - 7:37-39 - Habakkuk 2:14).  
50 It is completely foolish to try to defend Judaism in these days when the exact identity of Yahweh the God of Israel has already been revealed by Jesus of Nazareth. But those who even secretly hold it in their hearts seem to propose another understanding of the words of the book of the prophet Zechariah by asserting that the two anointed ones of whom Zechariah has spoken (Zechariah 4:11-14) are the high priest Joshua the son of Jehozadak and the governor Zerubbabel, and that the mysterious servant whose existence is revealed by the prophet Zechariah to the priest Joshua and whose name is Branch (Zechariah 3:8 - 6:11-13) is in fact Zerubbabel who is already known to Joshua and who is governor of the territory of Judah within the kingdom of the Persian king Darius (Haggai 1:1-5 - Ezra 5), and that it is not the foreigners who will work in the future to build the true house of Yahweh (Luke 7:1-5 - 4 Rommel 12:70) but rather the descendants of Jacob who were returning to Jerusalem over time like Ezra and Nehemiah who came there during the reconstruction of the wall of Jerusalem long after the reconstruction of the house of Yahweh (Ezra 4:1-5 - 7:1-7,8-10 - Zechariah 6:15). All of this is completely insane for three reasons. The first reason is that no one gives a mysterious name to a person whose name is already known, and the second reason is that the content of Zechariah 6:13 must be modified to suggest that it is not the same person who should be a king sitting on his throne and a high priest, and the third reason is the very definition of Judaism in 4 Rommel 6:2-3. Now I have established that the end of the book of Ezekiel was written with a certain form of humor that encourages repentance from the one whose desire is to cling to the law given by Moses to the children of Jacob (Ezekiel 40–48 - 2 Rommel 21-24), and I think that the end of the book of Zechariah was written with another form of humor that encourages contempt for one whose desire is to cling to this law given by Moses (Zechariah 12–14). Considering all these circumstances, it is not surprising that these real actors choose to say that the five books of the Torah of Moses (Genesis - Exodus - Leviticus - Numbers - Deuteronomy) were invented by a very intelligent people at a time when they felt the desire to build a cultural identity for themselves. 
51 I should normally thank several people and one of them is no longer of this world. But I choose to entirely dedicate this book on the knowledge of God to one of my elder sisters, Rosine Nanda, who has been present for a little over twenty years, almost two years after the beginning of my investigations in mathematical physics in 2002. Because several of her own initiatives have completely directed my steps to date. But I will also mention the young Kassandra Wehrlen for her emotional support (read and share), and Stefan Heinz Peter for all the financial assistance over the past several years [for more than ten years], and Jean Dutchou and Marthe Djiogue my parents according to the flesh, and the mathematician Jacques Azéma (1938 - 2019) who was one of my teachers in 2006 and who is the teacher who left the greatest impression on me by his personality, may his memory be a blessing, he and his colleague René Spector (1939 - 2018), may his memory be a blessing, but also their colleagues Lionel Moisan and Pierre Calka for their simplicity when I contacted them by email in September 2006 thinking to have made a discovery for the description of the notion of relative immobility in mathematical physics. Now I remember that I had not wanted to contact the other two because Pierre Calka had told me at some point that I seemed to be only seeking closeness with the already experienced teachers. I also want to quote the Egyptologist Ahmed Osman for his original theories concerning religion, in order to nourish the contradictory debate, and the preacher Chaudhry Rajinder Nijjhar Jatt who contacted me at the beginning of December 2020 and who allowed me to remember the analysis that I had done a few years earlier concerning the Gospel of Thomas, and Jonathan David Doolin for his way of doing things [thank you for your simplicity Jonathan], but also the religious researcher William Mayor and physics researcher Alan Dennis Clark for having manifested their interests, and also the philosopher of sciences Roberto Torretti (1930 – 2022) who kindly replied to me in July 2013, may his memory be a blessing. I really think all the evil that I have said of those who claim to be of jewish origin whether by conversion or not. For I myself have noticed all the subtleties of their behaviors, it has not just been told me. But I also think that the apostle Paul must be right when he says that they are not all dogs (5 Rommel 2:27 - Romans 9:1-13) [But I repeat it, Judaism must completely disappear for the glorification of the God of Israel, for the love of Jesus Christ, and those among them who are not ignorant are simply human waste (1 Rommel 1:17 - Ecclesiastes 7:23-24)]. 
52 Pope Francis of the Roman Catholic Church, 13 September 2024, a few months before Donald John Trump became president of the United States for the second time, and the two controversial salutes made by the businessman Elon Reeve Musk on the day of the second inauguration of the president, and the publication by the president of an image generated by artificial intelligence of himself disguised as the pope, a few months before the announcement by the president in office of the French Republic Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron of his intention to recognize the right of the Palestinian people not to live in slavery (1 John 4:20-21), eleven months before Donald John Trump declared that he wanted to do his best to go to Heaven if possible: There is only one God. And we, our religions are languages, paths to reach God. Some are Sikh, some are Muslim, some are Hindu, some are Christian, but they are different paths. So 'My religion is more important than yours', or 'Mine is the true one, yours is not true', this can only lead to destruction. God is God for everyone. And since God is God for everyone, we are all children of God. But 'My God is more important than yours', is it true (to compare with Psalms 82 and John 1:1-18). 
53 It is remarkable that the ability to speak in different languages ​​is the first gift distributed by the holy spirit, and also the most mentioned in the testament of Jesus Christ which describes the early days of Christianity (5 Rommel 14). There may be a natural justification for this, since the apostles and disciples then had the opportunity to interact more easily with other communities, and thus spread in their own words the message of the Gospel which is inseparable from the complexity of the Hebrew Bible (Psalms 32:1-6 - 4 Rommel 7:18-19 - Luke 1:67-75,76-79 - 1 John 2:21-25,26-29 - 2 Peter 1:1-11,12-15 - Philippians 3:1-3 - Romans 10:1-4). This is implicit in the recent statement of Donald John Trump on the occasion of the Pentecost [that is to say, the day that has been chosen to be the memory of this event in order to continually inform new generations of the content of a message that is useful to them], from which the following is an excerpt: On Pentecost, fifty days after the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead on Easter Sunday, the Holy Spirit descended on his apostles in the form of a mighty wind, empowering them to speak in tongues and proclaim the good news of the Gospel to lands and peoples near and far. 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit', the apostle Peter boldly declared. Equipped with the courage, clarity, and grace of Almighty God, in the years that followed, the apostles went on to withstand tremendous danger to bring hearts, minds, and souls to the Christian faith, marking the beginning of the Church against which even the evils of hell will not prevail. More than two thousand years later, the holy spirit continues to descend on all those who proclaim the name of Christ, enabling them to spread the Gospel.
