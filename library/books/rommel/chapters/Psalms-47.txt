1 A psalm of the sons of Korah. Clap your hands, you all the peoples. Shout to God with a voice of triumph. 
2 For Yahweh the Most High is awesome. He is the great king over all the earth. 
3 He has subdued peoples under us, and the nations under our feet. 
4 He has chosen our inheritance for us, [and this inheritance is] the glory of Jacob whom he has loved. Pause. 
5 The ark of God has been moved to his resting place with shouts of triumph. Yahweh has been praised with the sound of the trumpet. 
6 Sing praises to God, sing praises. Sing praises to our king, sing praises. 
7 For God is the king of all the earth. Sing praises with understanding. 
8 God reigns over the nations. God is sitting on his holy throne. 
9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together to be the people of the God of Abraham, because the shields of the world belong to God. He is greatly exalted.
