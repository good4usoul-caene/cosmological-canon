1 A psalm of David. My soul blesses Yahweh, and all that is within me praises his holy name. 
2 My soul blesses Yahweh, and forgets none of his blessings. 
3 He who forgives all your iniquities, and heals all your diseases. 
4 He who redeems your life from destruction, and crowns you with mercy and kindness. 
5 He who satisfies you with good things, and reinvigorates you like a young eagle. 
6 Yahweh is righteous, and he does justice to all those who are oppressed. 
7 He made known his ways to Moses, and his works to the children of Israel. 
8 Yahweh is merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in kindness. 
9 He does not argue continuously, he does not keep his anger forever. 
10 He does not act toward us according to our sins, he does not reward us according to our iniquities. 
11 For his goodness is great toward those who fear him, as the sky is high above the earth. 
12 He can take our sins from us and put them in the distance, as far as the east is separate from the west. 
13 Yahweh has compassion for those who fear him, as a father has compassion for his children. 
14 For he knows what we are made of, he remembers that we are dust. 
15 The days of man are like grass. It blooms like the flower of the field. 
16 And it faints and disappears when the wind comes over it, and it is no longer known by the place in which it was. 
17 But the lovingkindness of Yahweh endures forever and ever for those who fear him, and also his righteousness toward their descendants. 
18 He acts thus toward those who keep his covenant, those who remember his commandments to do them. 
19 Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingship rules over all things. 
20 Bless Yahweh, you his angels. You are mighty in strength, to perform his orders by obeying the voice of his word. 
21 Bless Yahweh, you all his armies. You are his servants to do his pleasure. 
22 Bless Yahweh, you all his works in all the places that he has made. My soul blesses Yahweh.
