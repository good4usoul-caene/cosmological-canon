1 And king Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land [of his kingdom], and on the islands of the sea. 
2 Now all the acts of his power and of his might, and the details of the greatness to which the king raised Mordecai, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia. 
3 For Mordecai the Jew had become the second authority in the land, next to the king Ahasuerus. He was great among the Jews, and he was beloved by the multitude of his brothers the Jews. And he sought the happiness of his people, and brought peace to all the Jews.
