1 Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke in the following words. 
2 Power and terror belong to God. He makes peace in his high places. 
3 On whom does his light not rise. Are not his armies innumerable. 
4 And how can a man be righteous before God. How can he who is born of a woman be pure. 
5 Behold he gives no light to the moon, and the stars are not pure in his sight.
6 How much more man who is only a worm, and the son of the man who is only a worm.
