1 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. 
2 I say of Yahweh: He is my hope and my fortress, my God in whom I trust. 
3 Surely he will save you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence. 
4 He will cover you with his wings, and you will be safe under his feathers. His faithfulness is a shield and a breastplate. 
5 You will not be afraid of the terror of night, nor of the arrow that flies by day. 
6 Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that strikes at noonday. 
7 A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. 
8 You will merely have to look with your eyes, and you will see the reward of the wicked. 
9 For you have said, Yahweh is my hope. You have made the Most High your refuge. 
10 No evil will befall you, no plague will come in your tent. 
11 For he will command his angels to preserve you wherever you go. 
12 And they will bear you in their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone. 
13 You will walk on the lion and the venomous snake. You will trample the young lion and the snake with your feet. 
14 I will save him because he loves me. I will exalt him because he knows my name. 
15 He will call on me, and I will answer him. I will be with him during his troubles. I will free him, and I will honor him.
16 I will satisfy him with a long life [which is the eternal life], for I will show him my salvation.
