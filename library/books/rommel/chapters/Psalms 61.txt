1 A psalm of David. Hear my cry, O God. Be attentive to my prayer. 
2 I cry to you with a broken heart, from the ends of the earth. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 
3 For you are my hope, a strong tower in front of the enemy. 
4 I will dwell forever in your tabernacle, because I trust only in the shelter of your wings [that is to say, your laws]. Pause. 
5 For you, O God, have heard my vows. You will give an inheritance to each of those who fear your name.
6 You will give the king a long life, you will let him live forever. 
7 He will dwell before God forever. Your goodness and your faithfulness will preserve him. 
8 Therefore I will sing praise to your name continuously, by performing my vows every day.
