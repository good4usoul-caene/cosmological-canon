1 The prophecy concerning Moab. The same night when it is ravaged, Ar of Moab is destroyed. The same night when it is ravaged, Kir of Moab is destroyed. 
2 He has gone up to the temple and to Dibon, the places of worship, in order to weep. Moab laments for Nebo and for Medeba. All their heads are shaved, and every beard is cut off. 
3 They are covered with sackcloth in their streets. Everyone groans and weeps abundantly on their housetops and in their broad places. 
4 Heshbon and Elaleh cry out, and we hear their voice as far as Jahaz. Even Moab's warriors lament, they are frightened in the soul. 
5 My heart laments for Moab, whose fugitives flee to Zoar, an heifer of three years old. For they are weeping while going up to Luhith, they cry out in despair on the path of Horonaim. 
6 For the waters of Nimrim are dried. Therefore the grass has withered, the herbs fails, the greenery has disappeared. 
7 Therefore, they will carry beyond the brook of willows what they have gathered and what they have stored up. 
8 For the cries surround the borders of Moab. His lamentations sound to Eglaim, his lamentations sound to Beer-elim. 
9 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood. For I will bring more on Dimon, a lion against those of Moab who have escape and against the remnant of the land.
