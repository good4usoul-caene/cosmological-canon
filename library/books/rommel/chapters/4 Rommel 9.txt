1 How to offend or please the holy spirit (John 5:39-40 - Jeremiah 9:23-24), second part: Selected pieces.
2 Joab strikes Absalom (2 Samuel 18:9-15) whom he brought back to the king (2 Samuel 14:1,18-21) and who rebelled after burning his field (2 Samuel 14:28-33).
3 Without involving the holy spirit in his motives, Naboth refuses a transaction offered to him honestly and in the light of day (1 Kings 21:1-3) by a king whom he is supposed to obey (1 Samuel 8). 
4 Yet he must have known that the commandments of Yahweh (Numbers 36:6-9 - Ezekiel 47:13-14,21-23) are much more about the quality of intentions than actions, since in his time the tabernacle of Moses was already replaced by the house built by Solomon. For Solomon is the third king of Israel and the last to reign over the twelve tribes united, before the separation of the people into two kingdoms. 
5 And with her husband’s permission, Jezebel decides to take justice by dark ways by inciting others to offend the holy spirit (1 Kings 21:4-23).
6 Simeon and Levi acted with anger (Genesis 34:13-31) and did not forgive those who wished to repent (Genesis 34:1-12).
7 For they could have simply rejected their proposal and demanded reparation (Deuteronomy 22:28-29 - Genesis 49:5-7).
8 She has not previously offended him in any way on her own initiative, and yet Judah makes a promise to his daughter in law without any sincerity when he is under no obligation to do so. Therefore he will have to suffer the consequences (Genesis 38:1-26).
9 Jeroboam abandoned the members of the tribe of Levi (Deuteronomy 10:8-9) by granting their livelihood to others and led the people away from the holy spirit by appointing new gods (1 Kings 12:26-31 - 2 Chronicles 11:1-12,13-17 - 1 Kings 14:1-16). He could have caused to build an equivalent of the tabernacle of Moses and used the Levites as priests [At the beginning of the reign of Solomon the son of David, there were at least two distinct places that deserved to be holy: the location of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the location of the tabernacle that Moses had built in the wilderness], or he could have done nothing and trusted Yahweh enough as Abraham did (Genesis 15:6 - 1 Kings 11:29-39).
10 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and Sancherib king of Assyria, and Haman servant of king Ahasuerus, each wanted to give himself more importance than the holy spirit (Daniel 4:30 - 2 Kings 19:9-13 - Esther 3:1-5,6-11, 5:9-14) who is the true God of Israel (Daniel 4:31-37 - 2 Kings 19:17-28 - Esther 6).
11 Thus, Solomon did not sin against the holy spirit by the fact that he exercised freedom from the commandments of Moses (Deuteronomy 17:14-20 - 1 Kings 11:1-2 - Leviticus 10:16-20) but precisely by the acts of idolatry that he actually committed (1 Kings 11:3-10).
12 Although David will continue to live through Solomon not only through the teachings which he transmitted directly to him and which will actually be used, but also through the family tree to a lesser extent since each is responsible for his own sin.
13 Solomon who was not directly offended by Shimei (1 Kings 2:8-9 - 2 Samuel 16:5-12 - 19:15-23) made a proposal to him which he accepted (1 Kings 2:36-38) and which he could not keep (1 Kings 2:39-46).
14 Thus, we do not see a direct offense from Amalek (Deuteronomy 25:17-19) towards Saul when the angel sends him to destroy this people (1 Samuel 15:1-3) but this does not mean that such a widespread offense did not exist against Saul or Israel.
15 It must be admitted that the scriptures do not specify every detail known to each stakeholder in every context.
16 And that there has never been any difference between those who practice righteousness and integrity according to the information at their disposal, whatever be the peculiarities of the community in which they evolve (Jeremiah 27:1-22 - 43:1-13 - 2 Kings 5:1-18 - 2 Chronicles 35:20-23 - Ephesians 3).
17 On the one hand a pharaoh loved by God welcomed Jacob (Genesis 47:1-11) and others who was less loved did not pass on to future generations an admirable inheritance (Exodus 1:7-10 - 2:23-25 - 3:16-22 - 12:40-41 - 14:16-18). 
18 On the other hand God loved king David (1 Chronicles 22) and he was angry with some of his descendants according to the flesh (2 Chronicles 36).
