1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses in the following words. 
2 Speak to the children of Israel and say, When a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a male, she will be unclean for seven days. She will be unclean as at the time of her menstrual indisposition. 
3 And on the eighth day the child’s foreskin will be circumcised. 
4 And she will stay another thirty three days to purify herself of her blood. She will not touch anything holy and will not enter the sanctuary until the days of her purification are fulfilled. 
5 But if she gives birth to a daughter, then she will be unclean for two weeks and as at the time of her menstrual indisposition. And she will stay another sixty six days purifying herself of her blood. 
6 And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son or for a daughter, she will bring to the priest a lamb a year old for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle dove for a sin offering. She will bring them at the door of the tent of meeting. 
7 And the priest will offer them before Yahweh, and make an atonement for her. Then she will be cleansed of the loss of her blood. This is the law for a woman who gives birth to a son or a daughter. 
8 But if she does not have enough to get a lamb then she will bring two turtle doves or two young pigeons. One for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering. And the priest will make an atonement for her, and she will be clean.
