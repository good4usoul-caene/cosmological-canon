1 Come, and let us return to Yahweh. For he has torn, but he will heal us. He has smitten, but he will bind up our wounds. 
2 After two days he will revive us. On the third day he will raise us up, and we will live in his sight. 
3 Then we will know, if we endeavour to know Yahweh. His going forth is prepared as the morning, and he will come to us like the rain, like the latter rain that waters the earth. 
4 What will I do to you, O Ephraim. What will I do to you, O Judah. For your goodness is like a morning cloud, like the dew that quickly vanishes. 
5 Therefore I will strike them with the prophets, I will kill them with the words of my mouth. For my judgments will go forth like the light. 
6 For I desire the search for obedience and not sacrifices. I desire the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 
7 But they have transgressed the covenant like Adam did. They have acted treacherously against me. 
8 Gilead is a city of evildoers, and is polluted with blood. 
9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent. For they commit lewdness. 
10 I have seen horrible things in the house of Israel. There is the whoredom of Ephraim, and Israel is defiled. 
11 For you also, O Judah, a harvest is prepared, when I bring back the captivity of my people.
