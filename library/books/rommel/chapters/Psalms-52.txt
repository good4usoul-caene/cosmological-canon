1 A psalm of David. When Doeg The Edomite came to inform Saul, and told him that David had gone to meet Ahimelech [the high priest]. Why do you boast of your wickedness, O mighty man. It is only the lovingkindness of God that will endure without ending. 
2 Your tongue only builds malice, and is like a sharp razor that works deceitfully. 
3 You love evil more than good, and you prefer deception to righteousness. Pause. 
4 You love all the words that offend the good spirit of anyone who hears them, O deceitful tongue. 
5 Therefore God will destroy you forever. He will grab you and pluck you from your tent, he will uproot you from the land of the living. Pause. 
6 The righteous will see it and will fear. And he will pity the wicked with the following words. 
7 This is the man who did not take God to be his strength. For he trusted in the abundance of his riches, and he made of malice his strength. 
8 As for me, I am in the house of God like a green olive tree in an appropriate place. For I trust in the mercy of God, I will trust forever and ever. 
9 I will always praise you because of what you have done [since you have caused me to exist in order to give me a certain legacy]. I will hope in your name, because this is what is good to do for all your saints.
