1 A psalm of David. Help me, O Yahweh, because the godly have gone. The faithful have been destroyed from among the children of men.
2 They speak deceitfully every man to his neighbour, flattering with their lips, and speaking with a double heart. 
3 May Yahweh destroy all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaks arrogantly. 
4 For they have said: We will prevail with our tongue, our lips belong to us. Who is our lord. 
5 But Yahweh has said: I will arise because of oppression against the powerless, because of the sighs of the humble. I will bring salvation to him whom the wicked has snared. 
6 The words of Yahweh are pure words, as the silver melted seven times in order to be purified in a furnace on the earth.
7 You will fulfill the promises of your word, O Yahweh. You will preserve forever the memory of each one of those who are righteous in the midst of this generation. 
8 The wicked walk on every side when baseness is exalted among the sons of men.
