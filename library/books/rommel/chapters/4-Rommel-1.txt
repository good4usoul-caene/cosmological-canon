1 Introduction. 
2 Rigorously it is legitimate to designate a living being by any information that it has actually created in the world and whose evolution, over time and under the effect of various interactions, has produced such or such other describable consequence. 
3 With this approach an identity does not disappear when the living being becomes inert and a notion of eternal life is scientifically possible.
4 One is present in eternal life when one has contributed physically or morally to the genealogy of something that exists, a material object or knowledge. And this contribution is exactly the form of our heavenly body.
5 However, at best one imagines a density of presence of such person in such accessible reality but this definition of eternal life does not allow the scientist to carry out a hierarchy of responsibilities so as to be able to clarify the religious notions of hell and heaven.
6 In other words, to be saved directly or to be saved only through fire (eventually by undergoing a progressive eradication of one’s presence in eternal life to leave at most a disgusting memory - Deuteronomy 29:20 - John 6:47-50,51-58 - Numbers 14:21-23,27-32 - Luke 20:34-38). 
7 A different analysis helps to understand this classification.
8 The world around us seems to be changing in two ways in any place at any time. There are modifications whose origin is simply a natural phenomenon which does not involve any direct contribution of a living being. 
9 And there are modifications undertaken by a living being in order to satisfy at least one of the three fundamental desires namely: (a) Solve what seems to be a problem for one's well-being. (b) Obtain from certain others physical or moral compensation. (c) Contribute to the development of those who may resemble oneself in their search for a purpose in their lives. 
10 A state of mind is a superimposition of one or more fundamental desires.
11 And whatever its state of mind at an arbitrarily chosen moment in its existence, a living being modifies the world by carrying out either an innovation or an imitation of a knowledge transmitted to it by specific sources. 
12 The perceptible universe is therefore transformed by a combination of natural causes, and imitations and innovations based on a set of knowledge acquired and carried out under different states of mind by living beings. 
13 Here is the message of faith in Jesus Christ.
14 Each heavenly body is described by an abstract concept that characterizes its impact on those who are physically alive. Every physical being is an embodiment of an abstract concept in the sense that its actions, which depend on the information at its disposal, are always consistent with its intrinsic nature (Jeremiah 1:5 - Romans 8:29).
15 There is a state of mind called the holy spirit. It is the deep conviction of being well-intentioned in relation to arbitrarily chosen strangers in society.
16 This spirit is the friend of Abraham, and the mighty of Jacob, and the shadow of David, and the master of the great kings Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus, and the God of Israel. 
17 All ordinary human beings are born without being indwelt by the holy spirit and without having knowledge of this notion therefore they must commit sins because by definition a sin is only a wilful or involuntary offense towards God the holy spirit (Jeremiah 22:13-16 - Psalms 14:1-7 - 24:1-10 - 1 Chronicles 28:9 - Luke 21:14-15).
18 The holy spirit can be offended between conception and birth, before coming out of the womb. 
19 And when one acquires knowledge of this notion, one cannot be indwelt by the holy spirit without obtaining in some way from those who are still physically alive, if we have the possibility, forgiveness of those whom we have actually offended without any publicly acceptable motivation. [But since the holy spirit is a state of mind, a person can acquire the holy spirit by understanding what needs to be done and by making a firm inner resolution to do it.]
20 For in eternal life we are not what we are credited with but what we have actually done (2 Rommel 6 - 4 Rommel 6:21-22).
21 Or without having ourselves forgiven those who have offended us, but forgiveness does not mean forgetting and ignoring it by not taking appropriate precautions at a later stage (1 Corinthians 5:9-13). David’s sin was forgiven but he still received a punishment (2 Samuel 12:10-14).
22 The acquisition of the holy spirit makes a person a new creature through the concerns that now constitute one’s motivations (2 Corinthians 6:14-18 - Colossians 3:1-11 - Philippians 4:8-9).
23 Not everyone is destined for eternal life (1 John 2:19-20) since one is led to eternal shame by blasphemy against the holy spirit, when one commits any sin after acquiring a perfect knowledge of this notion. 
24 Our actions always depend on the totality of the information that is at our disposal in real time and it is only works carried out under the influence of the holy spirit (3 Rommel 1:16-17) that are strengthened (2 Chronicles 20:34-37 – 25:5-10 - Psalms 101 - 133 - Proverbs 31:1-9 - Jeremiah 45 - Ecclesiastes 3:14 - Malachi 1:1-5), possibly in the form of an accumulated experience (Jeremiah 36), so as to endure eternally by their admirable consequences (1 Rommel 3:30-32 - 2 Chronicles 9:7-8 - John 17:1-3 - Ephesians 1:15-19,20-23).   
25 In eternal life innovations shine as stars and imitations shine as the splendor of sky, God having prepared for each elect an original achievement likely to be indefinitely imitated by those who know about it (2 Kings 7:1-9 - John 14:1-2).
