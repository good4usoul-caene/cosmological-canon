1 The land that was attributed by lot to the children of Joseph is from the Jordan near Jericho to the waters of Jericho eastward, and to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho by the mount Bethel. 
2 And it goes out from Bethel to Luz, and passes along to the borders of the Archites by Ataroth. 
3 It descends westward to the coast of the Japhletites, to the coast of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer. And its ends are at the sea.
4 So the children of Joseph, namely Manasseh and Ephraim, they took their inheritance.
5 And the borders of the children of Ephraim according to their families, the border of their inheritance on the east side were Ataroth-addar to Beth-horon the upper. 
6 This border extends to the sea as far as Michmethath in the north, and this border turns eastward to Taanath-shiloh and passes along it eastward to Janoah.
7 And it goes down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarath, and reaches Jericho, and goes out at the Jordan. 
8 And this border extended from Tappuah westward to the river Kanah, and its ends are at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, according to their families. 
9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were part of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, and these cities had their villages. 
10 And they did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of Ephraim to this day and were subjected to a tribute.
