1 A psalm of Asaph [for the afflicted who awaits an intervention of his God]. My voice is lifted up to God, and I cry. My voice is lifted up to God, and he hear me. 
2 I seek the Lord in the day of my distress. My hands are stretched out in the night, my soul refuses to be comforted. 
3 I remember God, and I groan. I meditate, and my spirit is full of anguish. Pause. 
4 You keep my eyelids awake, I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 
5 Then I consider the days of old, the years of ancient times. 
6 I remember the songs that delighted my heart during the nights. I ponder within my heart, and my spirit is diligently searching. 
7 Will the Lord reject forever. Will he no longer be favorable.
8 Is his mercy gone forever. Will he never speak to us again. 
9 Has God forgotten to have compassion. Has he closed his tender mercies in his anger. Pause. 
10 I say: My suffering is that the right hand of the Most High is no longer the same. 
11 I remember the deeds of Yahweh, I remember your wonders of old. 
12 I will meditate on all your works, I will tell of your deeds. 
13 Your ways are holy, O God. Who is greater than our God. 
14 You are the God who does wonders. You have made known your power among the peoples. 
15 You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Pause. 
16 The waters saw you, O God. The waters saw you and were afraid, and the depths trembled. 
17 The clouds poured out water, thunder resounded in the sky, and your arrows flew on every side. 
18 The voice of your thunder resounded all around, lightning lighted the world. The earth shook and trembled. 
19 You walked through the sea, and your path was in the great waters, but your footprints could not be seen. 
20 You led your people like one lead a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
