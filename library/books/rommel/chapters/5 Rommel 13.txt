1 Comments on the epistles of the apostles and the gospels, third part: Features of books.
2 About Peter's letters.
3 It seems to me that Peter speaks mainly of the man Jesus whom he also calls Christ, and this is in no way a fault because of the principle of the second trinity.
4 And he sometimes refers to Christ in two forms (to the man and the only begotten Son) in the same sentence. 
5 But there are cases where he refers only to the only begotten Son of God, sometimes by designating him otherwise (Lord, shepherd, bishop) as in 1 Peter 2:25.
6 About Paul's letters.
7 As I explained in the section 'The Humor of the Scriptures', Paul expresses himself in a particular way to a particular audience. 
8 Paul was for the Gentiles what Moses was for the Hebrews, a guardian to teach the beginning of wisdom, that one might understand what is meant by the righteousness of the heart which is pleasing to God (4 Rommel 6:29-30 - 7:18-19 - 12:62-65 - Deuteronomy 4:1-6,7-8 - 3 Rommel 1:54-57). 
9 But since the elect of God are one people since his only begotten Son sits at his right hand, it is fitting to say that Paul gave the milk to the body of Christ, who must then grow on his own and learn to choose good and to reject evil, as I point out in the section 'Falsifications in the Bible'. 
10 All is permitted to him who acts in the name of the only begotten Son of God, but it is not necessary to say it brutally to a child (1 Corinthians 3:1-2).
11 About the letter of John.
12 In his first letter John, I think the word Jesus refers to the man Jesus in a single verse (1 John 1:7) and everywhere else in his text, 'Jesus' or 'Jesus Christ' refers to Christ who is the only begotten Son of God and who remained in the world after the departure of the man Jesus. 
13 Regarding the confession of sins, it is to those to whom we have wronged that we must confess our sin when it is necessary for the good of all.
14 About the Gospel of John.
15 Different verses are stated in a subtle way but are necessarily non-contradictory in a correct interpretation. 
16 So the conditions set out for accessing eternal life (John 3:16 - 6:47) should not be interpreted naively (John 6:53-56 - 13:34-35 - 14:15 - 4 Rommel 6:21).
17 About the Gospel of Luke.
18 It is necessary to love everyone and trust only in God (Luke 12).
