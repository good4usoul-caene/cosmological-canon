1 A psalm of David. Yahweh is my light and my salvation. Who will I fear. Yahweh is the strength of my life. Of whom will I be afraid. 
2 When the evildoers come against me to eat my flesh, these same people from my persecutor and my enemies are those who stumble and fall. 
3 If an army were to encamp against me, my heart would not be afraid. If war were to arise against me, I would nevertheless be confident. 
4 I ask one thing from Yahweh, and it is the thing that I desire the most. I want to dwell in the house of Yahweh during all the days of my life, to admire the beauty of Yahweh and to enquire in his temple. 
5 For his house would be my shelter in the time of trouble. He would hide me in the shelter of his house, and he would set me up on a rock. 
6 And now my head is lifted up above my enemies who are around me. Therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tabernacle. In other words, I will sing. Yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh. 
7 Hear my voice when I cry to you, O Yahweh. Have mercy on me and answer me. 
8 You have said to your people, Seek my face. And my heart says to you: I seek your face, O Yahweh. 
9 Therefore do not hide your face from me, do not reject me in your anger. You are my help. Do not forsake me nor fail me, O God of my salvation. 
10 For my father and mother may forsake me, but Yahweh will care for me.
11 Teach me your way, O Yahweh. Lead me in the right path because of my enemies. 
12 Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries. For false witnesses have risen up against me, and they are planning atrocious things. 
13 I would faint if I did not hope to see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living. 
14 Hope in Yahweh. Be strong, and he will comfort your heart. Trust in Yahweh.
