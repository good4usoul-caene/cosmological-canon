1 A psalm of David. Yes, it is in God that my soul confides. My salvation comes from him. 
2 Yes, he is my strength and my salvation. He is my refuge, therefore I will not waver.
3 Until when will you imagine deceptions in order to cause the fall of the one who acts with simplicity. You all wish his death, you all who do not fear me completely. You see in him a wall that bends, or a tottering fence. 
4 They conspire to thrust him down from his dignity. They take pleasure in lies, they bless with their mouths while cursing in their hearts without having publicly acceptable justifications in their hearts. Pause. 
5 But my soul confides in God, because my hope is in him.
6 Yes, he is my strength and my salvation. He is my refuge, therefore I will not fall. 
7 My salvation and my glory are in God. He is the rock of my strength, my trust is in God. 
8 Confide in him continuously, you all the people. Pour out your hearts before him, for God is our hope. Pause. 
9 Surely the children of men are vanity [because it is futile to trust in them], and those who are leaders in the organizations of human societies represent a form of lie [in the sight of God]. All these false shelters would be lighter than a breath if they were lay in a balance.
10 Do not trust in the possibility that you have to do oppression or robbery [because this way will not allow you to achieve your goals with satisfaction, without this being followed by any unpleasant surprise through cause and effect relationships]. And if your riches increase, then do not let it become your main concern [that is to say, do not forget to practice justice and equity].
11 God spoke once, and it took me twice to understand the following thing: the power belongs to God. 
12 And mercy also belongs to you, O Lord. For you reward every person according to his work.
