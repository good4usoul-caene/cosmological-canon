1 And Yahweh said to Moses, I will bring another plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you leave here. When he completely lets you go, he will even drive you out of here. 
2 Speak now to the people, that every man may ask his neighbor and every woman may ask her neighbor for silver and gold jewels. 
3 And Yahweh caused the people to find favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. And Moses himself was highly regarded in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants and in the eyes of the people. 
4 And Moses said, Thus says Yahweh, About midnight I will pass through Egypt. 
5 And all the firstborn will die in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the maidservant who is behind the millstone, and even to all the firstborn of the animals. 
6 And there will be loud cries throughout all the land of Egypt, like there never was and like there never will be again. 
7 But among all the children of Israel, from man to beast, not even a dog will move the tongue. And you will know what difference Yahweh makes between Egyptians and Israel. 
8 Then all your servants here will come down to me and and bow down themselves to me and said: Get out, you and all the people who follow you. And after that I will go out. And Moses went out from Pharaoh's house in fierce anger. 
9 And Yahweh had said to Moses, Pharaoh will not listen to you so that my miracles may multiply in the land of Egypt. 
10 And Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before Pharaoh, and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and Pharaoh did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
