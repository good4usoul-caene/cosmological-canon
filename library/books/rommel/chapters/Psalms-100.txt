1 A Psalm of praise. Shout joyfully to Yahweh, you all the inhabitants of the earth. 
2 Serve Yahweh with gladness. Come before his presence with joy. 
3 Know that Yahweh is God. He has made us, and we are his. We are his people, the sheep of his pasture. 
4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courtyards with praises. Give thanks to him, and bless his name. 
5 For Yahweh is good. His mercy endures forever, and his faithfulness is the same in all generations.
