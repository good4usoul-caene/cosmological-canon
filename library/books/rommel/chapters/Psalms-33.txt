1 Rejoice in Yahweh, O you the righteous. For praise is suitable for the upright. 
2 Praise Yahweh with the harp, sing praises to him with the psaltery of ten strings. 
3 Sing a new song to him. Sing joyfully with a loud voice. 
4 For the word of Yahweh is right, and all his works are done in faithfulness. 
5 He loves righteousness and justice. The earth is full of the mercy of Yahweh. 
6 The heavens were made by the word of Yahweh, and all their host by the breath of his mouth. 
7 He gathers the waters of the sea together in a heap, he puts the deeps in storehouses. 
8 Let all the earth fear Yahweh, let all the inhabitants of the world tremble before him. 
9 For when he speaks, the thing occurs. And when he commands, there are consequences. 
10 Yahweh can bring the counsel of the nations to nought. He decides whether the plans of the peoples will be carried out or not. 
11 The counsel of Yahweh stands forever, and the thoughts of his heart are for instruction throughout all generations. 
12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, blessed is the people that he has chosen for his inheritance. 
13 Yahweh looks down from heaven, he examines all the children of men. 
14 He observes all the inhabitants of the earth from his dwelling place. 
15 He who forms the hearts of all and understands all their works. 
16 A king is not saved because of the multitude of his army, a mighty man does not triumph because of his great strength. 
17 It is not wise to rely solely on the horse for safety, it is not because of the great power of the horse that the plan will be a success. 
18 For the eye of Yahweh is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his mercy. 
19 To give them strength when they are hungry, to save their souls from death. 
20 Our soul waits for Yahweh, because he is our help and our shield. 
21 Surely our heart will rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. 
22 Let your mercy be on us, O Yahweh, because we wait for you.
