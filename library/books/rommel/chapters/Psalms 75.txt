1 A psalm of Asaph. We praise you, O God, we praise you. For your name is in our mouths, and we declare your wondrous works.
2 You say: I will judge with equity at a suitable time. 
3 The earth may tremble with all its inhabitants, but I have firmly established its pillars. Pause. 
4 I say to the boaster, Do not boast. And to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn. 
5 Do not lift up your horn on high, do not speak with a stiff necked.
6 For a lasting exaltation comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. 
7 For God is the judge. He humbles one, and exalts another. 
8 For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, and the wine is red. But it is a mixture containing a poison, and this poison is his anger. It is this wine that he makes serve to all the wicked of the earth, and they drink it to the last drop. 
9 I will declare these things continuously, and I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
10 And he say: And I will break down all the horns of the wicked, and the horns of the righteous will be exalted.
