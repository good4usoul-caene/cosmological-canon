1 I love Yahweh, because he has heard my voice and my supplications. 
2 Since he has inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. 
3 For the ropes of death had surrounded me, and the griefs of the grave had seized me. I was in trouble and in sorrow. 
4 And after having cleansed my heart by acknowledging my sin to the people whom I had previously offended without publicly acceptable justification, I called on the name of Yahweh by saying: I beseech you to save my soul, O Yahweh.
5 Yahweh is merciful and righteous. Yes, our God is full of compassion. 
6 Yahweh preserves the one who has a simple heart. I was brought low, and he saved me [since he has given me reasons to hope]. 
7 Return to your rest, O my soul. For Yahweh has been merciful toward you. 
8 For you have save my soul from death [by giving me reasons to hope], and my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 
9 I will walk before Yahweh in the uprightness of my heart, in the land of the living. 
10 I will believe in him even when I say: I am greatly afflicted.
11 For I say in my meditation: All men are liars. 
12 How will I repay Yahweh for the work that he has allowed me to accomplish. 
13 I will lift up the cup of my salvation, and call on the name of Yahweh. 
14 I will pay my vows to Yahweh now, in the sight of all his people. 
15 The death of each of his saints is something precious in the sight of Yahweh. 
16 O Yahweh, truly I am your servant. I am your servant and the son of your handmaid, and you have loosed my bonds. 
17 I will offer to you the sacrifices of praises, and will call on the name of Yahweh.
18 I will pay my vows to Yahweh now, in the sight of all his people. 
19 I will do it in the midst of you, O Jerusalem, in the courtyards of the house of Yahweh. Praise Yahweh.
