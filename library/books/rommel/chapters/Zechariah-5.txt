1 Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, a flying scroll. 
2 And he said to me, 'What do you see'. And I answered: I see a flying scroll. It is twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. 
3 Then he said to me: This is the curse that is going forth over the whole the land. For every one who steals will be cut off according to what is written on one side, and every one who swears [with evil intentions] will be cut off according to what is written on the other side. 
4 I am pouring it out, says Yahweh the God of armies, and it will enter the house of the one who steals and the house of the one who swears falsely in my name. And it dwell in the midst of his house, and it will consume that house with its timber and its stones. 
5 Then the angel who was talking with me went forth and said to me: Lift up now your eyes, and see what is this that goes forth. 
6 And I answered, 'What is it'. And he said, 'This is the ephah that goes forth'. And he added, 'This is their iniquity throughout the whole land'. 
7 And behold, there was lifted up a lump of lead, and a woman was sitting in the midst of the ephah. 
8 And he said, 'This is iniquity'. And he cast her down into the midst of the ephah, and threw the lump of lead on the opening. 
9 Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, there came two women, and the wind blew through their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. 
10 Then I said to the angel who was talking with me: Where are they carrying the ephah. 
11 And he said to me: They are going to build it a house in the land of Shinar. And it will be prepared, and set there in her own place.
