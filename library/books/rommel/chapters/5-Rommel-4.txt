1 The purpose of life. 
2 We are genetically children of our parents, but we are necessarily creations of God (Isaiah 45:9-12). 
3 Life is a pilgrimage. 
4 The only purpose of life is the circumcision of the heart of God's elect (Daniel 12:2-3). 
5 If a human has a circumcised heart from birth, then this human is the incarnation or reincarnation of a spirit who is already a son of God, like the man Jesus or John the Baptist (4 Rommel 14:12). 
6 No other human can be born with the circumcised heart (Romans 3:4 - 1 John 1:8-10 - Psalms 51:5-8 - John 3:3-8). 
7 This circumcision is done by the hand of God when one confesses the only begotten son of God, in other words when one realizes that it is always necessary to think and act out of love for the general interest without ever meditating any injustice against anyone, and without ever engage in any form of idolatry (Colossians 3:5-11 - Ephesians 5:6-11 - 1 Peter 1:22-23,24-25 - 2 Peter 1:1-8).
8 All the sins of the one who accepts the only begotten son of God in all aspects of his life are automatically forgiven (2 Peter 1:9-10 - Luke 11:34-36 - John 13:10-11 - Luke 5:17-26). 
9 By definition, and it must be understood that it is a definition, every person who has the circumcised heart automatically has the holy spirit and is a member of the body of Christ, even if the man Jesus is not known to this person (4 Rommel 6:46), as it is written (John 4:23 - Ephesians 1:13 - Galatians 3:26 - 2 Corinthians 3:18). 
10 We understand then that, if all sins are forgiven by the confession of the only begotten son of God, then no particular ritual is necessary to have eternal life, not even the ritual of baptism (1 Peter 3:21-22).
11 Any form of idolatry is incompatible with the justice of the heart that characterizes anyone who has confessed the only begotten son of God, because idolatry inevitably inculcates hatred (Luke 16:13).
