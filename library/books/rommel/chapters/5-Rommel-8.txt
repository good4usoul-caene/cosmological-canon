1 The bible is not the only way (Islam).
2 The circumcision of the heart does not necessarily come from the knowledge of the man Jesus. 
3 The man Jesus is not the way of all the chosen of God, but the Christ the only begotten Son of God is the way of all the elect of God (1 Colossians 1:17 - 1 John 5:20-21). 
4 Faith is not to know the holy scriptures, but only to observe the holy commandment (1 Thessalonians 4:3-8 - 1 Timothy 1:6-7 - Galatians 6:15 - 5:6 - 1 John 2:3-6 - 3:10). 
5 The man Jesus himself emphasized that he is not the way of all the elect (Luke 5:32 - Luke 19:10).
6 Thus, concerning Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, I who am not a descendant of Abraham according to the flesh, I do not absolutely think that the following scriptures have a negative connotation (Genesis 16:10-12 - 21:9-20 - Galatians 4:22-25).
7 I say then: certainly the prophet Muhammad was sent by God who is the creator of all things, and who desires that Ishmael (his posterity according to the spirit, made up of all those who choose him as a model) serve him by a particular way.
8 We know that the purpose of life is the circumcision of the heart therefore, necessarily but not with the same intensity, God uses persecution to test his elect (Genesis 15:13 - Psalms 34:17-20 - 2 Timothy 3:12 - 1 Peter 1:6-7 - 5:6-7 - 1 John 5:19).
9 And although ordinary humans are not born with the knowledge of the concept of justice, God the creator intended to lead astray those who are unjust according to their nature (2 Thessalonians 2:11-12).
