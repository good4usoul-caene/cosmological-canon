1 A psalm of the sons of Korah. As a deer strongly desires the water brooks, so my soul strongly desires you, O God. 
2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When will I come and appear before the face of God. 
3 My tears have been my food day and night, while my enemies tell me daily: Where is your God. 
4 I remember with a broken heart the times when I walked among the crowd and led them to the house of God. At these times we lifted up our voices to sing and praise, as a multitude keeping a feast. 
5 Why is my soul cast down now. Why is it groaning within me. But I wait for God, and I will always praise him because my salvation comes from his presence. 
6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me because I remember you from the land of Jordan, from the hill Mizar on the mount Hermon. 
7 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. All your waves and your billows are going over me. 
8 In a not so distant past, Yahweh was gracious to me by day and I sang his praises by night. I made prayers to the God of my life. 
9 And now I say to God who is my strength: Why have you forgotten me. Why must I walk in the sorrow caused by the oppression of the enemy. 
10 The provocations of my enemies make me feel like my bones are being broken. And they tell me daily: Where is your God.
11 Why is my soul cast down now. Why is it groaning within me. But I wait for God, and I will always praise him because he is my helper and my God.
