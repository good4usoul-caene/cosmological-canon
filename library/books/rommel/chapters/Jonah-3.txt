1 And the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the second time in the following words. [The second time concerning the events described in this book.] 
2 Arise and go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach there the message that I have commanded you. 
3 So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of Yahweh. Now Nineveh was a very large city, and a person had to walk for three days just to cross it. 
4 And Jonah began to preach when he entered the city to fulfill the first day of his mission, and he was speaking aloud and saying the following thing: Forty days more, and Nineveh will be destroyed. 
5 And the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fasting. And they put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them. 
6 For the words of Jonah reached the king of Nineveh, and the king arose from his throne, and took off his robe, and covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 
7 And he caused this proclamation to be published throughout Nineveh, by the counsel of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, neither ox nor sheep, taste anything. Let them not eat or drink water. 
8 But let them put on sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily to God. Yes, let them turn away every one from his evil way and from the violence of his hands. 
9 Who can tell if God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, so as not to destroy us. 
10 And God saw that they were acting thus, and were turning away from their evil way. And God repented of the evil he had intended to do to them, and he did it not.
