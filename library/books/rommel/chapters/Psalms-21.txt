1 A psalm of David. The king rejoices in your strength, O Yahweh. Yes, he greatly rejoices in your salvation. 
2 You have given him the desire of his heart, and you have not withheld the request of his lips. Pause. 
3 For you have come to him with the blessings of goodness, and you have set a crown of pure gold on his head. 
4 He asked life of you, and you gave him a long life forever and ever. 
5 His glory is great in your salvation. You have laid honor and majesty on him. 
6 For you have set him as a blessing forever. You have filled him with the joy of your countenance. 
7 For the king trusts in Yahweh, and it is because of the lovingkindness of the Most High that he will not fall. 
8 Your hand will identify all your enemies. Your right hand will identify those who hate you. 
9 You will make them like a fiery furnace in the time of your anger. Yahweh will destroy them in his anger, and the fire will devour them. 
10 You will destroy their fruit from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 
11 For they have conceived deception and have planned evil against you [your spirit]. Therefore they will not prevail continuously. 
12 For you will set them apart, and you will prepare the strings of your bow to shoot at their faces. 
13 Arise, O Yahweh, in your strength. We will sing and praise your power.
