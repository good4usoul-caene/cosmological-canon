1 Yahweh reigns, let the peoples tremble. He is sitting between the cherubim, let the earth tremble. 
2 Yahweh is great in Zion, he is high above all the peoples. 
3 Let them praise your great and awesome name, for it is holy. 
4 Let them praise the strength of the king who loves justice [for you are this king]. You have prepared equity, and you will perform righteousness and fairness in Jacob. 
5 Exalt Yahweh our God, and worship before his footstool. For he is holy. 
6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, and Samuel was among those who call on his name. They called on Yahweh, and he answered them. 
7 He spoke to them from a pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies, and the law that he gave them. 
8 You heard them, O Yahweh our God. You make them known that you are a merciful God, but you punished them for their transgressions. 
9 Exalt Yahweh our God, and worship before his holy mountain. For Yahweh our God is holy.
