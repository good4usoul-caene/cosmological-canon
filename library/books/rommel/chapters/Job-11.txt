1 Then Zophar the Naamathite spoke in the following words. 
2 Should not the multitude of words be answered. Or is it enough to be talkative to be right. 
3 Will your vain words silence people. Will you make fun, without anyone confusing you. 
4 For you say, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in your eyes. 
5 Oh if God would speak and open his lips to answer you. 
6 And if he reveal to you the secrets of wisdom, how you have deserved double according to justice. Know therefore that God has forgotten you because of your iniquity. 
7 Do you claim to probe the thoughts of God and attain the perfect knowledge of the Almighty. 
8 It is as high as the heavens, what will you do. And deeper than hell, what will you know.
9 Its measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea. 
10 If he passes through and takes possession, or if he calls for judgment, who will oppose him. 
11 For he knows vain men. He sees iniquity and the one who understands nothing. 
12 However, the vain man can become wise, for the newborn man is like a wild donkey. 
13 If you prepare your heart and stretch out your hands toward him. 
14 If you find iniquity in your hand and put it away, and do not let iniquity dwell in your tabernacle. 
15 Then you will surely raise up your spotless forehead, and you will be firm and without fear. 
16 And you will forget your suffering, and you will remember it like flowing waters. 
17 Your days will appear brighter than noon. You will shine and be like morning. 
18 And you will be full of confidence, because there is hope. Your undertakings will prosper and you will rest in safety. 
19 And you will go to bed without anyone disturbing you. And many will seek your favor. 
20 But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and their refuge will perish. And their hope will be the sorrow of spirit.
