1 David the man after the heart of the God of Israel. 
2 The holy spirit considers only the information at our disposal (Deuteronomy 23:24-25) and David who seeks only to satisfy a whim cannot approve what is not to be reproduced (1 Chronicles 11:15-19 - 2 Samuel 23:13-17). 
3 Valiant soldiers of Israel felt the fear and fled against Goliath without defiling their consciences because they recognized the unusual assets of the adversary (1 Samuel 17:4-7,24). 
4 And David, less impressive in appearance, volunteered to fight the enemy because he remembered confronting and defeating the lion and bear in a combination of circumstances (1 Samuel 17:33-37). 
5 Sin is only in what you desire through your actions based on what you know. 
6 She saves his life with sincerity (1 Samuel 18:6-9,22-29 - 19:9-18) and he remembers it (2 Samuel 3:14-16). 
7 He fears for his life (1 Samuel 21:10-12) and does not offend anyone (1 Samuel 21:13-15). 
8 Elsewhere he fears for his life and leaves it up to God to decide on a parameter that he cannot control (1 Samuel 22:20-23). 
9 He is offended to have worked without pay (1 Samuel 25:14-17,21-22) but revenge belongs to God (1 Samuel 25:25-44). 
10 It was the all-powerful God of David, whose identity is still unknown, who made Saul the king of Israel (1 Samuel 24:1-10 - 26:7-12 - 27:1-4 - Exodus 9:15-16). 
11 Furthermore, the Amalekite has offended the holy spirit (2 Samuel 1:1-10) and David is in a position to exercise justice against him who struck down a man for his own glory (2 Samuel 1:13-16).
12 Like any normal human being, the son of Saul was not born with the holy spirit but he agrees to make peace (2 Samuel 3:9-16). 
13 This is why David, who is in a position to do so, exercises justice against those who have struck a man for their own glory (2 Samuel 4:5-12). 
14 Jonathan showed kindness to David (1 Samuel 20) and he remembers it (2 Samuel 9). 
15 However, like Isaac and Esau (Malachi 1:2-3) or Amon and Josiah (2 Chronicles 33:21-25 - 34:1-2), the son according to Jonathan’s flesh is not also his spiritual son since he does not imitate the behavior of Jonathan (2 Samuel 16:1-4).
16 And faced with new information whose relevance he cannot determine, David acts in real time with fairness (2 Samuel 19:24-30 - 1 Samuel 8). 
17 David found himself in a complicated situation because everyone must commit sins and it is not a stranger who was offended (2 Samuel 13:11-22).
18 And he is convinced by Joab to let return Absalom (2 Samuel 14:21-24,32-33) who did not personally offend David.
19 David wants to be grateful but the recipients are mistaken, and rather than acknowledge their mistake they choose to make war on him (2 Samuel 10:1-7).
20 And they act out of pride for they know that to forgive does not mean to forget but rather to take precautions in the future (2 Samuel 16:20-23). [David and Joab and Amasa are of the same family (1 Chronicles 2:13-17), and Amasa was among David's enemies (2 Samuel 17:25) and it is unlikely that this was an appearance (2 Samuel 15:32-34). And it is not a contradiction if David wants to entrust new responsibilities to Amasa (2 Samuel 19:11-14) because David does not act as a man but as a king who wishes to reign over the entire population previously divided into two camps and who is in a context where he cannot repel all his former enemies]
21 Joab takes revenge in peacetime (2 Samuel 3:17-39) for an unfortunate event that occurred during the war (2 Samuel 2:17-28).
22 And in addition he disobeys king David who asks him to capture Absalom alive (2 Samuel 18:1-5,10-14).
23 Then David wants to take away his title of leader of the army (1 Chronicles 11:4-6 - 2 Samuel 19:11-13) and he opposes it by striking the one who did not offend him directly (2 Samuel 20:4-10), except by the fact that they were both from the same family and were the leaders of the two opposing armies during Absalom's rebellion. 
24 Therefore this information known to David must be transmitted to one who serves the same God and who is supposed to lead the same people (1 Kings 2:5-6).
25 David himself was not an incarnation of Christ (1 Kings 15:5) but merely his spiritual father (Luke 20:41-44).
26 And David’s work continuously shines before God because it is designed to be the basis of the teachings of God’s only begotten son, the light of the world.
