1 Then Moses went up from the plain of Moab to mount Nebo, at the top of Pisgah opposite Jericho. And Yahweh showed him the whole land. From Gilead to Dan. 
2 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah to the sea. 
3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, even to Zoar. 
4 And Yahweh said to him, This is the land that I swore to give to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob by saying, I will give it to your posterity. I have made it so that you will see it with your eyes, but you will not enter it. 
5 And Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Yahweh. 
6 And God buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor. But no one has known his grave to this day. 
7 Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyesight was not weakened and his vigor had not diminished. 
8 And the children of Israel mourned for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days. And these days of tears and mourning for Moses came to an end. 
9 And Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had put his hands on him. And the children of Israel obeyed him and did as Yahweh commanded Moses. 
10 But there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face. 
11 No one can be compared to him in all the miracles and wonders that Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants and against all his land. 
12 And in all that mighty hand and in all that great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
