1 A psalm of David the servant of Yahweh. The transgression of the wicked man causes me to say in my heart: There is no fear of God before his eyes. 
2 For he flatters himself in his own eyes, while his iniquity is found worthy to be hated. 
3 The words of his mouth are false and deceitful without justification. He does not know true wisdom and does not do good without reprehensible reasons. 
4 He plans iniquity on his bed. He walks in a way that is not good, and he does not abhor evil. 
5 The manifestation of your goodness reaches to the sky, O Yahweh. The manifestation of your faithfulness reaches the clouds. 
6 Your righteousness is like the great mountains. Your judgments are like the great deep. You save man and beast, O Yahweh. 
7 Your mercy is the most precious thing, O God. Those who are wise among the children of men take refuge in the shadow of your wings. 
8 They will be satisfied with the fatness [all the good things] of your house, and you will give them drink from the river of your pleasures. 
9 For with you is the fountain of life, and it is by your light [your teaching] that we will see light.
10 Increase your lovingkindness to those who know you, and your righteousness to those who are upright in heart. 
11 Let not the foot of proud people come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked prevail against me. 
12 There is a place for the workers of iniquity who have fallen. They are overthrown and will not be able to arise again.
