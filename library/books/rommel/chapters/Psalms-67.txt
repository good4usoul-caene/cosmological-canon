1 A psalm. May God have mercy on us and bless us. May he cause his face to shine on us. Pause. 
2 And thus we will make known your way on earth, and your salvation among all nations. 
3 Let the peoples praise you, O God. Let all the peoples praise you. 
4 Let the nations rejoice and be glad. For you will judge the peoples righteously, and you will govern the nations on earth. Pause.
5 Let the peoples praise you, O God. Let all the peoples praise you.  
6 Bless us O God, our God, and let the land yields its produce. 
7 May God blesses us, and may all the ends of the earth fear him.
