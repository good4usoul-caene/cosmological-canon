1 A psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness. Set me free in my distress, have mercy on me and hear my prayer. 
2 O you the sons of men, for how much longer will you dishonor my glory. For how much longer will you love vanity and seek to invent the best deceptions. Pause. 
3 Be assured that it is the godly man who pleases Yahweh. Therefore Yahweh will hear me when I call on him. 
4 Tremble, and sin no more. Examine your own heart on your bed, and be no more agitated. Pause. 
5 Offer the sacrifices of justice [that is to say, circumcise your hearts to become lovers of justice], and trust in Yahweh.
6 Many say: Who will make us see happiness. Make the light of your blessings shine on us, O Yahweh, by burdening us with riches. [These people want to be blessed by perishable things] 
7 As for me, your spirit puts more joy into my heart than all that they can possess when their wheat and wine multiply. 
8 I will go to bed and fall asleep being comforted by my love for you. Because it is only the confidence in you that reassures me, O Yahweh.
