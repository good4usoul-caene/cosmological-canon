1 A Psalm. Sing to Yahweh a new song. For he has done marvellous things. His right hand and his holy arm have given him victory. 
2 Yahweh has made known his salvation, he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations. 
3 He has remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
4 Shout for joy to Yahweh, you all the inhabitants of the earth. Sing praises and rejoice. 
5 Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp. With the harp and a sweet voice. 
6 And with trumpets, and with the sound of the horn. Shout for joy before Yahweh the king. 
7 Let the sea roar, and all that is in it. And also the world, and those who dwell in it. 
8 Let the rivers clap their hands, and let the mountains rejoice together before Yahweh. 
9 For he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
