1 A song of David that he sang to Yahweh concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. O Yahweh my God, I have put my trust in you. Save me from all those who persecute me, and free me. 
2 Lest they devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces while there is no one to help me. 
3 O Yahweh my God, if I have done an evil thing, if there is any wickedness in my hands. 
4 If I have rewarded with evil him who was at peace with me, or if I have planned evil against him who hates me without cause.
5 Then let the enemy chase my soul and take it. Let him trample my life until it falls to the ground, and lay my glory in the dust. Pause. 
6 Arise in your anger, O Yahweh, rise up against the rage of my enemies. Wake up for me according to the judgment that you have appointed. 
7 Let the assembly of the peoples surround you, and go up above them to the high place. [Give the judgment.] 
8 Yahweh will judge the peoples. Judge me, O Yahweh, according to my righteousness and according to my innocence that is in me. 
9 Put an end to the malice of the wicked, and establish the righteous. For you probe the hearts and the intestines [therefore you can do it], O righteous God. 
10 It is God who is my defender, and he saves the one whose heart is upright. 
11 God is a righteous judge, and God performs his judgments every day. 
12 If the wicked does not turn away from the evil way, then he sharpens his sword and bends his bow, and makes it ready. 
13 And he directs the deadly arrows that he has prepared towards the wicked. He makes his arrows fiery. 
14 The wicked plans to do evil. He designs projects of iniquity, and he produces falsehood. 
15 He begins a pit to trap others and digs it, but he will fall because of the pit that he has made. 
16 His wickedness will return on his own head, and his cruelty will fall on his own forehead. 
17 I will praise Yahweh because of his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of Yahweh the Most High.
