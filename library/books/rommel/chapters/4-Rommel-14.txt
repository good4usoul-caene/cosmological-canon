1 Conclusion. 
2 When we come into the world we find different narratives on various subjects and they all have a historical character so that a classification in order of usefulness can only be made after examining and understanding the teachings offered. 
3 The notion of eternal life is clearly stated (4 Rommel 1:1-12 - 8:13-14) and what belongs to the realm of belief is the methodology to follow in order to endure in this mathematical space that is inseparable from the perceptible universe (4 Rommel 1:25 - 2:26 - 4:3-4 - John 8:45-52).
4 Perhaps some rituals should be practiced at special times (John 14:3-6 - 2 Corinthians 5:1-7,8-15). The solution given by Jesus of Nazareth is the following thing: No one does anything without having a certain motivation inside himself, and what the creator of all things demands of each person is to have at every moment a justification that is PUBLICLY acceptable in his own eyes, even if he is the only one to know a part of the information that determines his behavior (Isaiah 51:12-13). In other words, his intentions must be continuously PUBLICLY justifiable in his own eyes (5 Rommel 4:1-7 - 5:44-45,46-47 - 4 Rommel 12:27 - 3 Rommel 1:49 - John 4:39-44 - Exodus 22:18 - Jeremiah 16:19-21 - Ecclesiastes 7:28-29). [Now the bible explains how this information that I have clarified, which is the definition of the Holy Spirit, was created in the world by Jesus of Nazareth (2 Corinthians 4:1-5). For every living being who comes into the world creates a particular information. And Jesus makes us understand that the ten commandments were given for the sole purpose of explaining how not to comply with them since what is interesting is why a person does something and not what that person does, and one of these ten commandments had the sole purpose of allowing a particular person called Christ to come into the world to create his particular legacy which consists in demonstrating the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 6:6-11 - Acts 3:17-21 - Psalms 110:1 - 2 Corinthians 5:19-21 - 6:1-13). And the ten commandments were declared to all the people who came out of Egypt (Exodus 12:37-38 - 20:18-23) for the sole purpose of perpetuating the personal legacies of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob (Genesis 18:18-19 - 49:10 - Malachi 1:1-3 - 4 Rommel 12:24-25), and the coming of the revelation of Christ was delayed by the great transgression of the people who had just come out of Egypt (1 Rommel 1:37 - 3:20 - 3 Rommel 1:47-49 - 4 Rommel 1:24).]
5 There has always been a subtle difference between obedience to God and strict observance of the commandments of Moses' pedagogical law (John 5:39-40,41-47 - 2 Kings 18:1-7 - 23:24-27 - 2 Chronicles 32:32-33 - 35:20-27). [During those days when the exact identity of God is still unknown, Hezekiah was attached to the spirit (2 Chronicles 30:1-21,22-27) and Josiah was attached to the law (2 Chronicles 35:1-19)]
6 And since at the moment of the application of any commandment each one is alone before his God (Leviticus 7:11-18 - 19:5-6 - 22:29-30 - Amos 4:1-5 - Leviticus 10:1-7,16-20 - Numbers 10:29-33 - 32:1-5,16-23 - 2 Corinthians 3:12-18 - 1 Samuel 4:1-22 - 7:1-17 - 1 Chronicles 21:28-30 - Joshua 22 - Colossians 1:24-29 - John 5:39-40 - Luke 7:23-30,31-35).
7 Therefore this document proposes blind confidence in a hypothesis recognized as timeless by an original analysis of part of the biblical texts (Acts 13:38-52).
8 Namely the Hebrew Bible, and the Gospels of John and Luke, and the Acts of the Apostles, and the letters of Paul(13), and the letters of Peter(2), and the letter of John(1). 
9 According to this theory which recalls natural selection in biology, populations as a whole tend to reproduce only, among the knowledge acquired in experimental situations, those that seem useful for the collective well-being.
10 As a result of this presentation, we must ask ourselves about the meaning of agnosticism and atheism by wondering if it is for the member to impose on oneself moral principles that one refuses by ignorance to designate by the word God (Daniel 3 and Daniel 4 and Daniel 6).
11 Or if it is a question of denying the existence of heavenly bodies, conceived as an extension of physical bodies by the notions of responsibility and intellectual property (2 Rommel 8 - 4 Rommel 12:33), by defending the freedom to flourish without ever worrying about a possible justification of our actions to the circumstantially identifiable interlocutors (1 Rommel 1:38). 
12 The observable physical death of the body is theologically attributed to the notion of sin which is individual without this excluding more precise causes studied by science. [For Jesus was born with the holy spirit since he did not commit any sin in his entire life, and consequently he was resurrected (1 Corinthians 15:12-22 - 2 Corinthians 5:19-21 - 1 Peter 2:21-22 - 1 John 3:3-7). And if John the Baptist who lived with the holy spirit died according to the flesh (Luke 1:12-15 - 7:24-30 - 9:7-9), it is because he was the reincarnation of Elijah (Malachi 4:4-6 - Luke 1:16-17 - 4 Rommel 2:63-64). For Elijah had not lived without sin like any other ordinary man, and Elijah had not yet died according to the flesh (2 Kings 2:11 - John 1:6-8). And John the Baptist seems not to know it himself since he recognizes himself only as the messenger who was announced by the prophet Isaiah (John 1:19-36 - Isaiah 40:1-5).]
13 And the question of the existence of a goal in life seems to be reduced to that to know if the one who has not simply wandered off at a certain stage of one’s life like king Solomon and who never cares about the interest of the rest of humanity as a whole can also transmit to future generations a heritage continuously used with admiration.
