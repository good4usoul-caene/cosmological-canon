1 Yahweh reigns. Let the earth rejoice, and let the multitude of islands be glad. 
2 Clouds and darkness surround him, righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 
3 Fire goes before him, and burns his enemies on all sides. 
4 His lightnings light the world. The earth sees it and trembles. 
5 The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 
6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory. 
7 They will be ashamed, all those who serve graven images or who trust idols [namely false gods]. For all the gods will worship Yahweh. 
8 Zion hears of it and rejoices. The daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments, O Yahweh. 
9 For you are the Most High over all the earth, O Yahweh. You will be exalted above all gods. 
10 You who want to love Yahweh, you must hate evil. He preserves the souls of his saints, he saves them from the hand of the wicked. 
11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 
12 Rejoice in Yahweh, you the righteous. Give thanks for his holy memorial.
