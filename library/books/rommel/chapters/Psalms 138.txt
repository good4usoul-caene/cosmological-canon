1 A psalm of David. I will praise you with my whole heart, I will sing your praises before the gods. 
2 I will worship toward your holy temple and praise your name, because of your lovingkindness and your truth. For you have glorified your name above all things by your word. 
3 I have called on you, and you have heard me. You have strengthened my soul. 
4 All the kings of the earth will praise you, O Yahweh, when they will have understood [the meaning of] the words of your mouth. 
5 And they will sing of the ways of Yahweh, because the glory of Yahweh is great. 
6 For Yahweh is great. And he is concerned about the legacy of the humble, and he recognizes the proud from afar. 
7 When I walk in the midst of trouble, you refresh me. You stretch out your hand against the anger of my enemies, and your right hand preserves me. 
8 Yahweh will perform the promises of his words that concern me. Your mercy endures forever, O Yahweh. Do not forsake the works of your hands.
