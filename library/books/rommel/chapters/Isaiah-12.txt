1 You will say in that day: I will praise you, O Yahweh. For you were angry with me, but your anger has turned away and you have comforted me. 
2 And behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and I will not fear. For the Yah Yahweh is my strength and my song. He has become my salvation. 
3 Therefore you will joyfully draw water out of the wells of salvation. 
4 And you will say in that day: Praise Yahweh, call on his name. Declare his works among the peoples, make mention of them in order to exalt his name. 
5 Sing to Yahweh, for he has done wonderful things. Let them be known throughout all the earth. 
6 Shout for joy and be glad before that day, O inhabitant of Zion. For he is great in your midst, the holy one of Israel.
