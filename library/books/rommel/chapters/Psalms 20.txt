1 A psalm of David. May Yahweh answer you in the day [the times] of trouble. May the name of the God of Jacob protect you. 
2 May he send you help from the sanctuary, and strengthen you from Zion. 
3 May he remember all your offerings and turn your burnt offerings into ashes. Pause. 
4 May he grant you the desires of your heart and accomplish all your plans. 
5 We will rejoice in your salvation, and set up the banner in the name of our God, when Yahweh will perform all your desires. 
6 Now I know that Yahweh will save his anointed, and will answer him from his dwelling place by the mighty help of his right hand. 
7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses. But we call on the name of Yahweh our God. 
8 They bow down and fall, but we rise and stand upright. 
9 Save us, Yahweh. Let the King [Yahweh] answer us when we call on him.
