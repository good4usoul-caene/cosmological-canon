1 After these things, the Lord appointed seventy other disciples, and sent them ahead of him two by two into every town and place where he himself was about to come. 
2 And he said to them: The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his harvest. 
3 Go your ways. Behold I am sending you forth like lambs among wolves. 
4 Do not carry purse, nor bag, nor shoes. And do not greet anyone on the way. 
5 Into whatever house you enter, you will say first: Peace be to this house. 
6 And if a child of peace is found there, then your peace will rest on him. If not, then it will return to you. 
7 And you will stay in a house that receives your peace, and you will eat and drink whatever they give you. For the worker deserves his wage. Do not go from house to house. 
8 In whatever town you enter, if they receive you then you will eat whatever is set before you. 
9 And you will heal the sick who are there, and you will say to them: The kingdom of God has come near to you. 
10 But whatever town you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say the following thing. 
11 We wipe even the dust from your city which has clung to our feet. But know that the kingdom of God has come near to you. 
12 I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom in that day than for that town. 
13 Woe to you, Chorazin. Woe to you, Bethsaida. For if the miracles that have been performed among you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, then they would have repented long ago by sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 
14 Therefore it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. 
15 And you, Capernaum, you are exalted to heaven but you will be thrust down to hell. 
16 Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me, and whoever rejects me rejects the one who has sent me. 
17 And the seventy returned with joy and said: Lord, even the demons obeyed us because of your name. 
18 And Jesus said to them: I have seen Satan falling like lightning from the sky. 
19 Behold I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. And nothing can harm you in any way. 
20 Nevertheless do not rejoice that the evil spirits obeyed you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven. 
21 At that very moment, Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said: I praise you, O Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and have revealed them to babies [that is to say, to those who do not obey their own wisdom and who act out of simplicity]. Yes, Father, because this is how it has seemed good in your sight. 
22 All things have been given to me by my Father. And no one knows who the Son is, except the Father. And no one knows who the Father is, except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal it. 
23 And Jesus turned toward his disciples, and said to them privately: Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. 
24 For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them. And they have desired to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them. 
25 And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tests Jesus by saying: Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life. 
26 And Jesus said to him: What is written in the Law. How do you read it. 
27 And he answered and said: You will love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your thought, and you will love your neighbor as yourself. 
28 And Jesus said to him: You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live. 
29 But he wanted to justify himself, and he said to Jesus: And who is my neighbor. 
30 And Jesus answered an said: A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers. And they stripped him of his clothes, and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. 
31 And it happened that a priest was going by that road, and the priest saw the wounded man, and he passed by on the other side. 
32 A there was also a Levite who came to the place, and the Levite saw the wounded man, and he passed by on the other side. 
33 And there was a certain Samaritan who was traveling, and the Samaritan came to that place and saw the wounded man, and he was moved with compassion. 
34 And the Samaritan came to him, and bandaged his wounds, pouring on them oil and wine. Then the Samaritan put the wounded man on his own beast, and brought him to an inn where he took care of him. 
35 And on the next day the Samaritan took out two pence and gave them to the innkeeper, and said: Take care of him. And whatever you spend more, I will repay you when I return. 
36 And now in your opinion, which of these three persons has been a neighbor to the one who fell among the robbers. 
37 And the lawyer said, 'It is the one who has shown mercy on him'. And Jesus said to the lawyer, 'Go and do likewise'. 
38 Now Jesus and his disciples were traveling, and he entered a certain town, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. 
39 And she had a sister named Mary, and Mary sat at the feet of Jesus and was listening to his words. 
40 And Martha was busy with various household tasks, and therefore she came to Jesus and said: Master, do you not care that my sister has left me alone to serve. Order her therefore to help me. 
41 And Jesus answered her by saying: Martha, Martha, you are anxious and upset about many things. 
42 One thing is necessary [and it is to perfect one's knowledge of the will of God]. Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.
