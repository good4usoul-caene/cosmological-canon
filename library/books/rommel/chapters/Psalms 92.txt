1 A psalm for the sabbath day. It is a good thing to thank Yahweh, and to sing praises to your name, O Most High. 
2 In order to declare your lovingkindness in the morning, and your faithfulness every night. 
3 By playing with an instrument of ten strings, and with the lute, and by adding the soft sound of the harp. 
4 For you have made me glad through your work, O Yahweh. I will rejoice in the works of your hands. 
5 Your works are so great, O Yahweh. Your thoughts are very deep. 
6 An unwise man does not know it, and a stupid man is not careful about it. 
7 The wicked may grow like the grass, and the workers of iniquity may blossom like flowers, but they [their works] will be destroyed forever. 
8 And you will honor your followers forever, O Yahweh. 
9 For lo, the fate of your enemies, O Yahweh. For lo, all your enemies will perish. All the workers of iniquity will be scattered. 
10 But you will exalt my horn, like the horn of a wild ox. For I am anointed with your fresh oil.
11 My eye will see my desires on my enemies, and my ears will hear what I hope from the wicked who rise up against me. [You do not desire the total destruction of the sinner, but that he be converted and live. And you will destroy the one who refuses to be converted.] 
12 The righteous will blossom like a palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
13 For the things that are planted in the house of Yahweh, will blossom in the courtyards of our God. 
14 They will still bear fruit in old age, they will be fat and flourishing. 
15 In order to make known that Yahweh is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
