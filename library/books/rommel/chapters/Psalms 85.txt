1 A psalm of the sons of Korah. For you have been favorable to your land, O Yahweh. You have brought back the captives of Jacob. 
2 You have forgiven the iniquity of your people, and have covered all their sins. Pause. 
3 You have taken away all your fury, you have turned back from the fierceness of your anger.
4 Restore us completely now, O God of our salvation. Stop completely your indignation against us. 
5 Will you be angry with us forever. Will you prolong your anger to all generations. 
6 Will you not reinvigorate us, so that your people may rejoice in you. 
7 Show us your lovingkindness, O Yahweh, and grant us your salvation. 
8 I hear what Yahweh God say. For he speaks peace to his people and to his saints, if they do not return to folly. 
9 Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him, and therefore glory can dwell in our land. 
10 Mercy and truth will meet together, righteousness and peace will kiss each other. 
11 Truth will grow from the earth, and righteousness will look down from heaven. 
12 Yahweh will give us good things, and our land will yield its fruit. 
13 Righteousness will go before him, and will mark his steps in the way.
