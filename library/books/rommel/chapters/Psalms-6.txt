1 A psalm of David. O Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger. Do not discipline me by your fury. 
2 Have mercy on me, O Yahweh, because I am weak. Heal me, O Yahweh, because my bones are troubled. 
3 My soul is greatly troubled. And you, O Yahweh, how long will you delay. 
4 Return, O Yahweh, and save my soul. Save me for the sake of your mercifulness.
5 For he who is dead can no longer sing your praises. How can one praise you from the grave. 
6 I am weary of my groaning. Every night my bed is soaked, because I water it with my tears. 
7 My eye is dimmed by my sorrow, because of all my adversaries. 
8 Depart from me, you all the workers of iniquity. For Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping. 
9 Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh will receive my prayer. 
10 All my enemies will be confused and cruelly tormented. They will be suddenly repelled and put to shame.
