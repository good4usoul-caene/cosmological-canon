1 I may speak with the tongues of men or of angels. But if I do not have love, then I am a sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. 
2 I may have the gift of prophecy [since it is possible to have certain gifts only by the will of God the father who wants to accomplish his goals, without the Holy Spirit being involved], or I may be able to fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, or I may have a faith so great that I can move mountains. But if I do not have love, then I am nothing. 
3 I may give all my goods to feed the poor, and I may give my body to be burned as an offering. But if I do not have love, then I gain nothing. 
4 Love is patient, and is kind. Love does not envy. Love does not boast, it is not proud. 
5 Love does not dishonor others, it is not selfish. Love cannot be made angry easily. Love forgives the wrong that it has received even if it does not forget [since forgiving is not forgetting but rather taking appropriate precautions]. 
6 Love does not rejoice in injustice, but rejoices in the truth. 
7 It suffers all things. Love always trusts in its own power, always hopes in its own power, always endures. 
8 Love never ends, while all the gifts will end. Where there are prophecies, they will cease. Where there are tongues, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will disappear. 
9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 
10 But when that which is perfect comes, that which is partial will disappear.
11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, and I understood like a child, and I thought like a child. But when I have become a man, I have put away the ways of childhood. 
12 For now we see through a glass, darkly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully as I myself am fully known. 
13 And now these three things remain: faith, and hope, and love. But the greatest of these things is love.
