1 A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. You are my God, O God. I will seek you fervently, my soul thirsts for you. My flesh longs for you in a dry and barren land, where there is no water.
2 For thus I may see you as in the sanctuary, thus I may contemplate your power and your glory. 
3 My lips will praise you, because your lovingkindness is better than all the pleasures of life. 
4 I will bless you during all the rest of my life, I will lift up my hands for your name.
5 My soul is satisfied with your praise, as my flesh is satisfied with good food. My mouth will praise you with joyful lips. 
6 I remember you on my bed, I meditate on you in the middle of the night. 
7 For you are my help, and I rejoice in the shadow of your wings. 
8 My soul clings to you, and your right hand upholds me. 
9 Therefore those who seek to destroy my soul will go to the depths of the earth. 
10 They will fall by the sword, they will be a portion for foxes. 
11 But the king will rejoice in God, and everyone who swears by him will rejoice in him. For the mouth of those who speak lies [without having publicly acceptable justifications in their hearts] will be stopped.
