1 I called on Yahweh in my distress, and he answered me. 
2 Keep the lying lips and the deceitful tongue away from me. [The one who mislead some others without having publicly acceptable justifications in his heart] 
3 You the wicked, here is what you will get because of your deceitful tongue. Here is what it will bring to you. 
4 The sharp arrows of a soldier, and burning coals to harm you. 
5 Woe is me, for I am like one who sojourns in Meshech or who dwells in the tents of Kedar.
6 My soul has dwelt too long with him who hates peace.
7 I am for peace. But when I speak, they are for war.
