1 A psalm of David. O Yahweh our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the world. Your majesty is exalted above the heavens. 
2 You have laid the foundation of your strength in the mouth of many young children and toddlers [Many of them are pleasant to your spirit] in order to confuse your adversaries, to silence the enemy and the avenger. 
3 When I consider the heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have created. 
4 Then I think: What is man, so that you focus your attention on him. And the son of man, so that you visits him. 
5 You have made him a little lower than angels, and have crowned him with glory and honor. 
6 You have given him dominion over the works of your hands, and you have put all things under his feet. 
7 Both sheep and oxen, and the beasts of the field. 
8 The birds of the air and the fish of the sea, and all that move along the paths of the seas. 
9 O Yahweh our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the world.
