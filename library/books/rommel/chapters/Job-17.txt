1 My breath is corrupted. My days are cut off, and the grave is ready for me. 
2 I am surrounded by scoffers, and my eye must endure their insults.
3 Come down now and put me in a safe place with yourself. Who is the one who will touch my hand. 
4 For you have hidden their hearts from understanding. Therefore you will not exalt them. 
5 For if a person flatters himself among his friends, then the eyes of his children will fall.
6 He [God] has also made me a proverb to the people, and I am an object of contempt before them.
7 Therefore my eye is darkened by sorrow, and all my strength is like a shadow. 
8 The righteous will be astonished, and the innocent will be moved against the hypocrite. 
9 Nevertheless the righteous will stand firm in his way, and the one whose hands are pure will increase his strength. 
10 But as for you all, return to your same speeches and I will not find a wise man among you. 
11 My days are gone, and my undertakings are broken. 
12 And the thoughts of my heart have turned the night into day, and the approaching light into darkness. 
13 Although I hope, the grave will be my house and I will make my bed in the dark. 
14 I will say to corruption, You are my father. And to the worm, You are my mother and my sister. 
15 Where is my hope now. Who will consider the things that I hoped for.
16 They will descend to the bottom of the pit [with me], they will surely stay together in the dust.
