1 A psalm of Asaph. God stands in the assembly of the gods. He stands as judge among the judges. 
2 How much longer will you judge unjustly by doing favors to wicked people. 
3 You must give justice to the powerless and fatherless, and protect the rights of the poor and needy. 
4 Help the poor and needy, save them from the hand of the wicked. 
5 But they have neither knowledge nor understanding, and they walk in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken. 
6 I had said: You are gods, you all are the sons of the Most High. 
7 Nevertheless you will die like a man [since the flesh will be destroyed], you will fall like any prince [since the fate of all human beings is the same]. 
8 Arise and judge the earth, O God [the Son]. For you will inherit all nations.
