1 My son, if you receive my words and keep my commandments within you. 
2 In order to incline your ear to wisdom, and to incline your heart to understanding. 
3 Yes, if you call on knowledge and lift up your voice for discernment. 
4 If you seek it as silver, and search for it as for hidden treasures. 
5 Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and you will find the knowledge of God. 
6 For Yahweh is the source of wisdom. Knowledge and understanding come from his mouth. 
7 He preserves the legacy of the righteous, he is a shield for those who walk uprightly. 
8 He preserves the way of his saints, because he keeps the paths of righteousness. 
9 If you obey him then you will understand the importance of justice, and of equity, and of righteousness. You will understand all the good paths. 
10 And when wisdom enters your heart, and knowledge delights your soul. 
11 Then instruction will guard you, and understanding will keep you. 
12 In order to save you from the way of evil, and from the man who speaks deceitfully. 
13 Namely from those who forsake the paths of righteousness to walk in the ways of darkness. 
14 And from those who take pleasure in doing evil, those who delight in perverseness. 
15 And from those who walk ignorantly in crooked paths, those who are crooked in their ways. 
16 And in order to save you from the strange woman, namely from the strange woman who flatters with her words. 
17 And from the woman who forsakes the guide of her youth by forgetting the covenant of her God. 
18 Surely her house leans toward death, and her paths lead to the dead. 
19 None of those who go to her will return, for they will never find the paths of life again. 
20 Therefore you must walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. 
21 For the upright will dwell in earth, the righteous men will remain there. 
22 But the wicked will be cut off from the earth, the transgressors will be uprooted from it.
