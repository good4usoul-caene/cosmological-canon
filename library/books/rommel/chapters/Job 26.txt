1 And Job spoke in the following words. 
2 Who are you helping now. Is it the one who has no power. Are you saving the arms that have no strength.
3 Are you giving advice to one who has no wisdom. I see that you produce an abundance of wisdom. 
4 Who are your words for. And who inspires you.
5 Dead things are formed under the waters, and their inhabitants. 
6 The tomb is bare before him, and the abyss has no veil. 
7 He extends the north over the void and suspends the earth in nothingness.
8 He binds the waters in his clouds, and the cloud is not broken under their weight. 
9 He covers the face of his throne, and spreads out his cloud on it. 
10 He marked out a boundary on the surface of the waters, even to the limits of light and darkness. 
11 The pillars of the heaven quake and are amazed at his reproof. 
12 By his strength he lifts the sea, and by his understanding he breaks their pride. 
13 By his spirit the heavens are garnished, and his hand formed the crooked serpent.
14 Lo, these are only the peripheries of his ways. How small is the part of him that we are aware of, and who can understand his fearful power.
