1 A psalm of David. Hear my words, O Yahweh, consider the intentions of my thought. 
2 Listen to the voice of my cry, my king and my God. For it is to you that I send my prayer. 
3 Hear my voice every morning, O Yahweh. For I turn to you every morning so that you may be the one who directs my steps.
4 For you are a God who hates wickedness. You are not with the person who plans to do evil. 
5 The foolish will not endure before your eyes, because you hate all the workers of iniquity. 
6 You will destroy those who tell lies to do evil. Yahweh abhors men of blood and fraud. 
7 As for me, I will come into your house because of the multitude of your mercies. I will bow down in your holy temple with the fear of your power. 
8 Teach me to walk in your righteous ways, O Yahweh, so that I may prevail against my enemies. Make my way straight before your face.
9 For the words of their mouths are not designed by honorable thoughts. Their heart is filled with malice, their throat is an open sepulcher, and they flatter with their tongue. 
10 Destroy them, O God. Let them fall by their own cunning plans. Let them be driven out because of the multitude of their transgressions, from which they have refused to turn away. For they are rebellious against you. 
11 But all those who trust in you will triumph, and they will rejoice forever. For you will defend those who love your name so that they may rejoice in you. 
12 For you bless the righteous, O Yahweh. You surround him with your love as with a shield.
