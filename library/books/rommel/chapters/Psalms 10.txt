1 Why do you stand afar off, O Yahweh. Why do you hide yourself in times of affliction. 
2 The pride of the wicked cause them to oppress the poor. Let them be taken in the traps that they have conceived. 
3 For the wicked boasts of the desires of his heart. He despises Yahweh by coveting perishable things. 
4 The wicked says in his arrogance that he will not be punished because there is no God. That is all he thinks. 
5 His ways prosper at all times. Your judgments are far above what he can perceive, therefore he mocks all his enemies. 
6 He says in his heart: I will never be moved, I have a minimum of security. 
7 His mouth is full of curses, and deceits and frauds. There is malice and injustice under his tongue.

12 Arise, O Yahweh. Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the powerless. 
13 Why does the wicked despise God. Why does he say in his heart that you will not punish him. 
14 But you see it. You look at deceit and wickedness, to requite it with your hand. The powerless submits his cause to you, because you are the helper of the fatherless. 
15 Break the arm of the wicked and of the evildoer. Search and requite his wickedness, until you find none. 
16 Yahweh is king forever and ever. The wicked will be cut off from his land. 
17 You hear the prayers of the afflicted, O Yahweh. You prepare their heart, you listen to them. 
18 To bring justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that a man made of dust may no longer cause fear.
