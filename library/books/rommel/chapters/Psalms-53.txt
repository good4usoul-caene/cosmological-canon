1 A psalm of David. The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God'. They have become corrupt, they have done abominable acts of wickedness, there is none who does good. 
2 God looks down on the children of men from heaven, to see if there is anyone who understands and seeks God. [Evil is that which is intentional and unjustifiable in the eyes of any assembly of saints]  
3 They have all gone astray, they have all become corrupt. There is none who does good. No, not even one. 
4 Have the workers of iniquity lost their minds. They eat my people as they eat bread, they do not call on God.  
5 But they will tremble because of fear, while there will be no cause for fear. For God will scatter the bones of those who encamp against you. You will put them into confusion, because God has rejected them.
6 Oh give salvation to Israel out of Zion. When God turns the captivity of his people, then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad.
