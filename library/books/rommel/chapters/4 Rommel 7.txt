1 The pedagogy initiated through Moses (Isaiah 1:2-3 - 2 Corinthians 3:12-18), second part. 
2 The following things happened after the destruction of their temple (Deuteronomy 13 - John 9:28-29). 
3 No (Leviticus 13:40-45 - 14:34-47 - 21:16-24 - 23:34-38,39-44 - Numbers 5:17 - 6:1-8,9-12,13-18 - 10:1-10 - 15:37-41 - Deuteronomy 16:1-3 - 24:8 - Exodus 31:12-18 - Numbers 9:1-14 - 2 Chronicles 30:1-3,13-21,22-27 - John 4:22). 
4 There are specific corners of our beard that we must not shave (Leviticus 19:27) so as not to offend the creator of heaven and earth. This is encoded in the Oral Law and as a precautionary principle we sometimes prefer not even to shave. 
5 We do not even speak his name because of all the respect we have for him (Exodus 3:14 - 34:14). And he promised us that he will subjugate the rest of mankind to our will when he sends the lion from the tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:9-10). Can a lion become a lamb (John 1:35-36). 
6 We do not eat pork. The promised land is for us and our children, and we do not want those who refuse to give the tithe to the tribe of Levi and who refuse that we teach them the will of the supreme being that is encoded in the nuances of biblical Hebrew (Deuteronomy 4:39). 
7 The throne of David must be strengthened forever (Psalms 89 - 2 Chronicles 13:1-12) by a person who will forever preserve the grace of God (1 Chronicles 17 - Psalms 132).
8 And it is not Solomon (1 Kings 11:9-13) because the temple is currently destroyed (2 Samuel 7:16 - 1 Chronicles 17:14). For this promise of God is not yet fulfilled despite the fact that Solomon actually built a house for Yahweh (1 Kings 2:1-4 - 6:11-13 - 8:25 - 9:1-9 - 11:29-39 - 15:1-5 - 2 Chronicles 7:11-22 - 2 Kings 8:16-19 - 2 Chronicles 21) because this house was destroyed and the people of the land of Judah were sent into exile. And according to the prophecy of the prophet Jeremiah there has been a return of the exiles, perhaps even from the other ten tribes of Israel who were previously scattered elsewhere at the ends of the earth. And then the temple was rebuilt in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah and Zechariah and Haggai, but there was never again a king in Israel to sit on the throne of David (Nehemiah 6:1-13). No legitimate heir is established today. 
9 But it could not be this Immanuel (1 Peter 1:16-21 - Isaiah 7:1-16 - Romans 4:17) whose name means 'God is with us' (Isaiah 8:5-10), and who is also call Jesus (Luke 1:26-35) whose name means 'salvation of God'. He has been announced for the house of David (Isaiah 7:13-16), namely to all the people who carry the inheritance of David, because they were in fear of being completely eradicated by the enemy (1 Rommel 3:14-15) [therefore it is not necessary that the fulfillment of this prophecy be directly related to the outcome of the ongoing battle]. And he has been announced to a king who is not even loved by God (2 Chronicles 28), and none of the identities of his parents is revealed, and no aspect of his function in the world is revealed. 
10 However, being jewish does not mean practicing a religion. It is a community united by the same universal values which are transmitted through the maternal womb (Genesis 41:38-45 - 46:20 - 48:5-6 - 49:22-26 - Numbers 34:13-15 - Ezekiel 47:13 - 1 Kings 14:21,31 - 2 Chronicles 12:13) and yet open to the conversions of strangers (Joshua 8:32-35 - Esther 8:17 - Isaiah 56).
11 But they cannot hope to incorporate the prestigious hereditary tribe of the Levites (Deuteronomy 18:1-2) which has a special connection with God through paternal blood in order to frequently offer to God his favorite food, namely the blood and fat of healthy animals. And to explain the law to the people and to judge difficult issues (Deuteronomy 15:19-23 - 17:1-13 - Nehemiah 8:6-12). 
12 We did not write this book which would have been translated into Greek before the coming of Jesus of Nazareth, we also received it but these are our traditions and the tradition must remain alive like the God who is described there (Numbers 14:28) while this Jesus of Nazareth died without fulfilling the prophecies on the glorification of the jewish people. And anyway, where is the proof that he actually existed. 
13 We want to build the house of God that the rest of the world will envy, we will cook meats in it (Exodus 18:11-12 - 20:24-26 - 1 Kings 19:21 - Zechariah 14:20-21 - Ezekiel 46:19-24). The burnt offerings are not eaten (Exodus 29:15-18 - Leviticus 1 - 1 Kings 3:4 - 2 Chronicles 1:1-6 - 29:25-31). But peace offerings and many categories of sin offerings, including transgress offerings when another human is directly offended by the sin, these are eaten (Exodus 29:19-22,31-34 - Leviticus 7:28-38 - 10:1-7,16-20 - 1 Kings 8:4-5,62-64 - 2 Chronicles 5:5-7 - 7:4-7 - 29:32-36).
14 The fat is burned and the blood is shed, and the people eat the remainder of the flesh after having given good portions to the members of the hereditary tribe of Levi while God will be hidden behind the veil (Deuteronomy 12:1-14,15-18 - 14:22-29 - 15:19-23) where he will be met once a year by a high priest descendant of Aaron (Exodus 30:9-10), on the occasion of a special ceremony which marks the fact that it is impossible for the people to be without sin (Leviticus 16 - 1 Rommel 3:35). 
15 But it is not because the very existence of the pedagogical law is a sin (Exodus 29:1-14 - Leviticus 8:13-17 - 4 Rommel 7:16-18) which gives a privileged position to the family tree of Aaron and Levi and which separates into two parts the Israel of God (Isaiah 8:13-18 - Micah 5:1-4 - John 11:50-52). 
16 No willful transgression that cannot be justified by any circumstantial constraint is forgivable (Numbers 15:22-31) but we know the difference between on the one hand the sins committed by involuntary transgressing the commandments concerning the particular rituals that are required in the written law (Leviticus 4). 
17 And in this situation something is lost if the transgression was committed by the whole assembly or by the descendant of Aaron who was anointed to serve as high priest (Leviticus 4:7,18 - 6:30). And the flesh of the victim is even burned with its excrement at the place where rubbish is thrown, far from the presence of Yahweh who is supposed to be in the sanctuary of the tent of meeting (Leviticus 4:10-12,20-21). 
18 And if this particular type of transgression [which concerns the particular rituals that are required in the written law] is not committed by one of these two similar categories of culprits, then the victim can be eaten (Leviticus 4:25,30,34 - 6:24-30 - 10:8-18). [Now Ezekiel has indicated that there will be another ritual in the future for this particular type of unintentional transgression (Ezekiel 45:18-20)]
19 And on the other hand the sins committed by inflicting harm on someone else with a guilty justification and in this situation we find the love of God only by obtaining the forgiveness of those whom we have offended and by performing guilt offerings [which is a transgress offering, a category of sin offerings]. There is no other way (Leviticus 5:1,4,14-16 - 6:1-7 - Numbers 5:5-10 - Hosea 6:6 - Proverbs 21:3 - Psalms 51:16-17 - Ezekiel 18:1-32 - 33:11-20 - Isaiah 1:10-20 - 57:15-21 - 4 Rommel 6:24). And this is the reason why we must recognize a benefit not only by thanking God, but also by recognizing the merit of the person whom God has to use to perform that benefit (Luke 17:11-19). [At the time of the construction of the temple of Ezekiel, which is supposed to exist after the coming of the prince described in his book, there will always be a distinction between the voluntary actions that a person does on his own initiative and the voluntary actions that this person does because of an external constraint (Ezekiel 46:12). And there will also be a distinction between the two types of transgressions which are on the one hand voluntary actions designed to offend other persons without having publicly acceptable justifications in the heart (and the apostle Paul also speaks of this type of transgression which becomes the only type of transgression in the gospel of Jesus - 1 Corinthians 5:1-5,9-13 - 6:1-3), and on the other hand the involuntary transgressions that do not directly offend other persons and concern only the particular rituals that are required in the written law (and the apostle Paul also speaks of this type of transgression which can become simply a divergence between sincere personal convictions in the gospel of Jesus - 1 Corinthians 3:1-8,9-15 - 4:1-6 - Acts 13:1-4 - 15:35-41 - Romans 14:1-5,6-13 - John 3:8), since this distinction is made in the names given to these two types of sins (Ezekiel 46:20). The temple of Ezekiel should be built to accommodate the one who is designated as the prince, and who will be like a king and like a priest and like God (1 Rommel 3:49). And we can notice that the guilt offering that Yahweh required of the friends of Job to be forgiven for having accused Job without justification is a burnt offering (Job 42:7-8) and therefore it is not meant to be eaten like the guilt offering required in the law given by Moses to the children of Israel. We must then understand that there is no contradiction because Job does not belong to the tribes of Israel (3 Rommel 1:27 - Micah 6:3-5,6-8), and the name Yahweh simply designates the holy spirit of Elohim (3 Rommel 1:2,8 - Malachi 1:4-5,11-14 - 2:17) and appears in this story because it is Moses who supposedly rewrote the story of Job as he also wrote the story of Balaam (Numbers 22:18) who was a prophet not coming from the tribes of Israel (Numbers 22:1-8). Elohim is the one who causes all things to happen, and Yahweh the holy spirit of Elohim has said to Moses that he is also Elohim and the only Elohim (Deuteronomy 4:39). Now the only thing that the holy spirit of Elohim does is build a useful personal legacy to each person who chooses to obey him blindly, and Jesus of Nazareth has had the best place because he never had anything to reproach himself for in the relationship between what he actually knew and why he was doing what he was doing (Philippians 2:8-11). And Jesus is the only person to have possessed the special gift of forgiving the sins of others (4 Rommel 5:8-9) because of his own nature (John 3:31-36 - 1 Corinthians 12:4-13 - 4 Rommel 2:62-65), because he was not an ordinary man (Ezekiel 43:1-4 - 44:1-3 - 46:8-9 - 47:1-6). Jesus has come into the world in order to teach all peoples the exact knowledge of the God of the concept of justice who is the only true God (Genesis 49:10 - John 11:45-52).] 
20 The word transgression can refer only to sins that directly offend another human being or more generally any sin concerning any commandment of Yahweh. Because identical words are used to designate things having a certain connection and then the exact meaning depends on the context.
21 After Moses who knew God face to face (Exodus 33:7-11 - Deuteronomy 34:9-12), Ezekiel is said to have been the only prophet who gave new laws for the people (Ezekiel 40–48). 
22 And these laws contradict the architectural teachings of Moses concerning the structure of the temple which is the place of worship (Exodus 26:1-15 - Ezekiel 44:1-2 - 48:29-35 - John 4:22). 
23 And also concerning the quantities of sacrifices that must be offered to Yahweh alone (Ezekiel 45–46 - Numbers 28–29 - 4 Rommel 13), the obligatory part of burnt offerings [and burnt offerings are not eaten]. But the laws concerning the offerings that are eaten have not been changed (Leviticus 2:1-16 - 3:1-17 - 7:1-10 - 1 Samuel 2:12-17,27-29 - Ezekiel 44:15-16). 
24 It is for us to be at the service of the only God who created everything and to whom everything belongs (Job 41:11 - Psalms 50:1-15 - Zechariah 7:1-10). 
25 But if we have to choose between Moses and Ezekiel then we prefer to choose Moses because this God has no sense of humor (Genesis 25:21-23,28-34 - 27:1-25 - 29:15-25 - Exodus 20:22-23 - 32:1-14 - 29:42-46 - 34:27-28 - Deuteronomy 10:8-9 - 31:19-27), contrary to the God of other prophets (1 Kings 8:9,25-30 - Ezekiel 43:6-12 - 1 Kings 22:1-23) and even the God of the gospel of Jesus Christ (Luke 7:1-9 - John 11:55-57 - 12:9-13,17-19). 
26 We must not add or subtract from the commandments given by Moses (Deuteronomy 4:1-2 - 12:32 - Isaiah 8:12-20), not for eternity but until the coming of someone who is immortal and who will teach us an additional message from God (Deuteronomy 18:18-20 - Jeremiah 31:31-34 - John 8:23-25). 
27 God insists that there be no mixing between the heritages of the different paternal tribes of Israel (Numbers 36 - Ezekiel 46:16-18 - 48:1-29) this is why we must find the lost tribes and identify their paternal tribes (Jeremiah 23:5-8).
28 Some of God’s people were scattered several centuries ago among the nations (2 Kings 17:1-23 - 1 Chronicles 5:10,18-26) but honesty and integrity is our motto, they will be found and gathered together in the promised land whose limits we know (Ezekiel 47:13-23). And we know all this because it is written in the Bible. 
29 And the scattered tribes did not return from exile at the same time as the tribe of Judah when the second temple was built after the destruction of that of Solomon, we are certain of it (2 Kings 25:1-22 - Jeremiah 3:1-16 - 30:1-24 - Ezekiel 20:27-44 - 34:11-24 - 37:21-28 - 3 Rommel 2:18). 
30 In the incomprehensible nature of their love for God or rather of the promises they hope to fulfill (Zechariah 14:16-21), it would not be surprising if they had a dubious interpretation of David’s words (Psalms 139:21-24) and try to apply this biblical passage to those who suggest them not to seek to identify their brothers and sisters on the face of the earth (Exodus 22:31 - Deuteronomy 14:21 - 23:19-20 - Galatians 3:22 - John 9:39-41). 
31 Because the final teaching is that we are all brothers and sisters, whether one is a master or a slave (Acts 10:24-43). 
32 And the holy spirit who distributes different gifts to different people (Acts 19:1-20 - 1 Corinthians 12:4-13) considers each person according to the information available and actually understood (Romans 10:1-4 - John 15:22-27 - Job 35:1-8). 
33 But sins committed in ignorance of the knowledge of the true God of Israel are to be compensated one way or another (Psalms 119:75 - 2 Timothy 2:13 - Lamentations 3:21-41 - Ecclesiastes 11:9-10 - 12:1-7 - 1 Peter 5:6-9).
