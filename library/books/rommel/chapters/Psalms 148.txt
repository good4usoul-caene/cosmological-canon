1 Praise Yahweh. Praise Yahweh from the heavens, praise him in the high places. 
2 Praise him, you all his angels. Praise him, you all his armies. 
3 Praise him, sun and moon. Praise him, you all the bright stars. 
4 Praise him, you the heavens of heavens, and you the waters above the heavens. 
5 Let them praise the name of Yahweh. For he commanded, and they were created. 
6 He has established their kinds forever and ever. He has made a decree which will not pass. 
7 Praise Yahweh from the earth, and you the sea monsters and you all the depths. 
8 Fire and hail, snow and vapor. And you stormy winds that arise to fulfill his word. 
9 Mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars. 
10 Beasts and all cattle, creeping things and flying birds. 
11 Kings of the kingdoms of the earth and all peoples, leaders and all judges on the earth. 
12 Young men and virgins, old men and children. 
13 Let them praise the name of Yahweh, for his name alone is excellent. His glory is above the earth and the heavens. 
14 And he has exalted the horn of his people, namely the praise from all his saints, the praise from the children of Israel who are a people placed near him. Praise Yahweh.
