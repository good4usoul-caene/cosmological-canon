1 A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Yahweh, my adversaries have increased. A multitude has arisen against me.
2 And many have said of my soul: There will be no help for him from God. 
3 But you are a shield for me, O Yahweh. You are my glory, the one who lifts up my head. 
4 I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he hears me while dwelling in his holy mountain. Pause. 
5 I lie down and sleep, and then I wake up. For it is the will of Yahweh. 
6 I will not be afraid of the ten thousands of the peoples who besieges me on every side. 
7 Arise, O Yahweh. Save me, O my God. For you smite all my enemies on the cheek bone, you break the teeth of the wicked. 
8 Salvation belongs to Yahweh, and your blessing is on your people. Pause.
