1 A psalm of David, when he fled from Saul and went into the cave. Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me. For my soul trusts in you. I will seek refuge in the shadow of your wings, until the calamities come to an end. 
2 I will cry to the God Most High, to the God who accomplishes all things for me. 
3 He will send from heaven, and he will save me from the persecution of him who wants to swallow me up. Pause. God will send his mercy and his faithfulness. 
4 My soul is among lions, my enemies are all around me like a devouring fire. Their teeth are like spears and arrows, and their tongues are like sharp swords. 
5 Exalt yourself above the sky, O God. Let your glory fill all the earth. 
6 My enemies have set a trap for my feet, my soul is bowed down. They had dug a pit for me, but they will fall into it themselves. Pause. 
7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed. I will sing songs of praise. 
8 Awake, my soul. Awake, my lute and my harp. I will awake in the morning to sing. 
9 I will praise you among the peoples, O Lord. I will sing to you among the nations. 
10 For your mercy extends beyond the sky, your faithfulness extends beyond the clouds.
11 Exalt yourself above the sky, O God. Let your glory fill all the earth.
