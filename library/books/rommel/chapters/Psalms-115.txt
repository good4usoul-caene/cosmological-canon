1 Do not act because of us, O Yahweh. Do not act because of us, but only for the glory of your name, and for the sake of your mercy and your faithfulness. 
2 Why should the nations say: Where is now their God. 
3 But our God is in heaven, and he does whatever he pleases. 
4 Their idols are made of silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
5 They have mouths, but they speak not. They have eyes, but they see not. 
6 They have ears, but they hear not. They have noses, but they smell not. 
7 They have hands, but they touch not. They have feet, but they walk not. They make no sound with their throat. 
8 They are worthless like those who make them, like all those who trust in them. 
9 Trust in Yahweh, O Israel. For he is your help and also your shield. 
10 Trust in Yahweh, O house of Aaron. For he is your help and also your shield. 
11 You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh. For he is your help and also your shield. 
12 Yahweh remembers us, and he will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron. 
13 He will bless those who fear Yahweh, both small and great.
14 Yahweh will greatly reward you and your [spiritual] children. 
15 Blessed be Yahweh, he made the heaven and the earth. 
16 The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh, but he has given the earth to the children of men. 
17 The dead do not praise Yahweh. None of those who are in silence praises him. 
18 So we will bless Yahweh from this time and forever. Praise Yahweh.
