1 Sing to Yahweh a new song. Sing to Yahweh, you all the inhabitants of the earth. 
2 Sing to Yahweh, and bless his name. Proclaim his salvation from day to day.
3 Declare his glory among all nations, and his wondrous works among all peoples. 
4 For Yahweh is great and deserves to be highly praised. He is to be feared above all gods.  
5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens. 
6 Honor and majesty are before him, strength and joy are in his sanctuary. 
7 Praise Yahweh, you all the families of the peoples. Praise the glory and the power of Yahweh. 
8 Praise the glory of the name of Yahweh, bring an offering [a peace offering for gratitude] and enter his courtyards. 
9 Worship Yahweh for the beauty of his holiness. Tremble before him, you all the inhabitants of the earth. 
10 The world is established and will not be moved. Yahweh will judge the peoples in righteousness. Say among the nations: Yahweh reigns. 
11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad. Let the sea roar, and all that is in it. 
12 Let the field exult, and all that is in it. Let the trees of the forest sing for joy before Yahweh. 
13 For he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples in his truth.
