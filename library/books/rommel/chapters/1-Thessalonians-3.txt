1 Therefore, as we were increasingly impatient to see you and could not come to you, we decided to stay alone in Athens and to send you Timothy. 
2 He is our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, and we sent him to strengthen and comfort you in your faith. 
3 So that no one may be shaken by the present afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined to experience such things. 
4 And when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we would be persecuted, just as it has happened, as you know. 
5 So, growing impatient, I sent to find out about your faith, because I was afraid that the tempter had overcome you, and that our labor had been in vain. 
6 And Timothy, who has recently come from you to us, has brought us good news of your faith and love, and has told us that you always have a good memory of us, desiring to see us as we also desire to see you. 
7 Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and affliction, we have been comforted about you because of your faith. 
8 For now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord. 
9 We have so much joy before our God because of you, and we thank God for you. But we cannot thank him enough for all the joy that we feel. 
10 Night and day we pray exceedingly for the opportunity to see you again, in order to perfect your faith by filling what it may lack. 
11 May our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, guide our journey toward you. 
12 May the Lord increase more and more among you and toward everyone this love that we ourselves have for you. 
13 In order to strengthen your hearts and to make it blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
