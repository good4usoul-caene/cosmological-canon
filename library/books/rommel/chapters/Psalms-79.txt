1 A psalm of Asaph. The nations have invaded your inheritance, O God. They have defiled your holy temple, and have made Jerusalem heaps of stones. 
2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food to the birds of the air, and the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth. 
3 Their blood have been shed like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them. 
4 We have become an object of reproach to our neighbors, an object of scorn and of derision to those who are around us. 
5 How long, O Yahweh. Will you be angry forever. Will your anger burn like fire. 
6 Pour out your fury on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call on your name. 
7 For they have devoured Jacob, and made his dwelling desolate.
8 Remember no more our past iniquities, but let your tender mercies come quickly to meet us. For we are in great misery. 
9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Forgive our sins and save us, for the sake of your name. 
10 Why should the nations say, Where is their God. Act so that the nations and our eyes may know that you have avenged the blood of your servants, the blood that has been shed. 
11 Let the groans of the captives come before you. Preserve those of your servants who are about to perish, according to the greatness of your power. 
12 Repay seven times in the hearts of your enemies the grief that they have caused by insulting you, O Lord.
13 As for us, we are the sheep of your flock and we will praise you forever. We will declare your praises from generation to generation.
