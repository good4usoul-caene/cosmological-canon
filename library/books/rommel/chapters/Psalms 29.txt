1 A psalm of David. Exalt Yahweh, you who are godly. Recognize in him the glory and the strength. 
2 Glorify the power of his name [his identity]. Worship Yahweh for the beauty of his holiness. 
3 The voice of Yahweh can be heard on the seas when the God of glory thunders. It is Yahweh who cries out over the raging waters [for all the phenomena of nature are the work of his hand]. 
4 The voice of Yahweh is powerful, the voice of Yahweh is full of majesty. 
5 The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars. Yes, Yahweh breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
6 He makes them leap like a calf, and Lebanon and the Sirion like young buffaloes. 
7 The voice of Yahweh cuts the air with flashes of lightning. 
8 The voice of Yahweh causes the wilderness to tremble. Yahweh causes the wilderness of Kadesh to tremble. 
9 The voice of Yahweh causes the hinds to give birth, and it destroys the forests. In his holy dwelling in heaven, all his angels say: Glory. 
10 Yahweh is sitting on the floods. Yes, Yahweh reigns over all things forever. 
11 Yahweh will give strength to his people [that is to say to everyone who fears him], Yahweh will bless his people with peace.
