1 Wisdom has built her house, and she has hewn out her seven pillars. 
2 And she has killed her beasts, and mixed her wine, and prepared her table. 
3 And she has sent her maids to cry out the following words on the highest places of the city: Whoever is simple-minded, let him come here. 
4 She says the following thing to those who lack understanding. 
5 Come to eat of my food, and to drink of the wine that I have prepared. 
6 You the foolish, forsake your way in order to live. Walk in the way of understanding. 
7 He who rebukes a scoffer will receive contempt as the reward from this person. And he who reproves the wicked will get hurt. 
8 Do not rebuke a scoffer, lest he hate you. But rebuke a wise man, and he will love you. 
9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be wiser. Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. 
10 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. The knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 
11 For your days will be multiplied by me, and the years of your life will be increased. 
12 If you are wise then you are wise for yourself. And if you are a scoffer then you alone will bear it. 
13 Foolishness is that other woman who is noisy. She is simple-minded, and knows nothing. 
14 She sits at the door of her house, on a seat on the highest places of the city. 
15 To call passersby who continue straight on their way. 
16 And she says: Let him who is stupid come in here. 
17 She says to the one who is deprived of understanding: Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. 
18 And the simple-minded person does not know that the dead are there, and that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
