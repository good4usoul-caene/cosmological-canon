1 Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
2 And I said, 'Where are you going'. And he said to me: I will measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it will be and how and long it will be. 
3 And behold, the angel who spoke with me went forward, and another angel went out to meet him. 
4 And he said to him: Run, speak to this young man and say, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited like a village without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock who will be there'. 
5 For I will be to it a wall of fire all around, says Yahweh, and I will be its glory within it. 
6 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, says Yahweh. For I have scattered you to the four winds of the heaven, says Yahweh. 
7 Escape, O Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon. 
8 For thus has said Yahweh the God of armies, after he has sent me on a glorious mission to the nations that are plundering you [you who want to please him now, and not your fathers who had refused to listen to him]. For whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye. 
9 For behold, I will stretch out my hand against them, and they will be a spoil to those who served them, and you will know that Yahweh the God of armies has sent me. 
10 Shout and be glad, O daughter Zion. For lo, I come and I will dwell in your midst, says Yahweh. 
11 And many nations will join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and will become my people. And I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that Yahweh the God of armies has sent me to you. 
12 And now, Yahweh will possess Judah as his portion in the holy land, and he will choose Jerusalem again. [For the word of Yahweh will go forth from there to spread throughout the whole earth.] 
13 Let all flesh be silent before Yahweh. For he has arisen from his holy place.
