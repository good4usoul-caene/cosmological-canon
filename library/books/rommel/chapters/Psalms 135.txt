1 Praise Yahweh, praise the name of Yahweh. Praise him, you the servants of Yahweh. 
2 You who stand in the house of Yahweh, in the courtyards of the house of our God. 
3 Praise Yahweh, for Yahweh is good. Sing praises to his name, because it is good to do so. 
4 For Yahweh has chosen Jacob for himself, and Israel for his own possession. 
5 For I know that Yahweh is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 
6 Yahweh does whatever he pleases, in the heaven and on the earth, in the seas and in all the depths. 
7 He brings the clouds from the ends of the earth, he sends the lightnings and the rain. He brings the wind out of his treasuries. 
8 He smote the firstborn males in Egypt, both of man and beast. 
9 He sent signs and wonders in the midst of you, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and against all his servants. 
10 He smote great nations, and killed mighty kings. 
11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og ​​king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan. 
12 And he gave their land for an inheritance, an inheritance for his people Israel. 
13 Your name endures forever, O Yahweh. Your memorial endures from generation to generation. 
14 For Yahweh will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants. 
15 The idols of the nations are of silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
16 They have mouths, but they speak not. They have eyes, but they see not. 
17 They have ears, but they hear not. There is no breath in their mouths. 
18 They are worthless like those who make them, like all those who trust in them. 
19 Bless Yahweh, O house of Israel. Bless Yahweh, O house of Aaron. 
20 Bless Yahweh, O house of Levi. Bless Yahweh, you who fear Yahweh. 
21 Blessed be Yahweh out of Zion, he who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise Yahweh.
