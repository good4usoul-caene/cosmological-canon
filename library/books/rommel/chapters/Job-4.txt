1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered in the following words. 
2 If we dare to communicate with you, will you be afflicted. But who can restrain himself from speaking. 
3 Behold you have taught many people, and you have strengthened the languid hands. 
4 Your words have lifted up those who were falling, and you have strengthened the knees of the weak. 
5 But now that it is about you, you are getting weaker. Now that you are affected, you are distressed. 
6 Is not your fear of God the thing that sustains you and constitutes your confidence, and your hope, and the righteousness of your way. 
7 Search in your memory, I pray you. Who is the innocent who perished, or who are the righteous who were destroyed. 
8 As for me, I have seen that those who cultivate iniquity and sow wickedness always reap the same thing. 
9 They perish by the breath of God, and they are consumed by the wind of his wrath. 
10 The roar of the lion and the voice of the lioness and the teeth of the young lion are all broken. 
11 The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 
12 Now something was secretly brought to me, and my ear received its light sounds. 
13 At the moment when the visions of the night agitate the thoughts, when a deep sleep falls on men. 
14 I was seized with fear and terror, and all my bones shook. 
15 And the wind passed before me, and made the hairs of my flesh to stand up. 
16 Then someone stood before me, and I knew not his face. An image was before my eyes, and I heard a voice softly whispering the following words. 
17 Would man be righteous before God. Would a man be purer than his creator. 
18 Behold he found no steadfastness in his servants, and put madness on his angels. 
19 How much more in those who dwell in houses of clay, who come from dust and can be crushed like a worm. 
20 From morning to evening they are broken. They perish forever without consideration. 
21 Does not their dignity go with them. Do they not die without wisdom.
