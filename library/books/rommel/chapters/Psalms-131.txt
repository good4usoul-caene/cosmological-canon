1 A psalm of David. O Yahweh, I have neither a proud heart nor haughty eyes. I do not set goals without having plans that I can perform to achieve them. 
2 For I behave calmly like a weaned child who is with his mother. My spirit within me is like that of a weaned child. 
3 O Israel, put your hope in Yahweh from now on and forever.
