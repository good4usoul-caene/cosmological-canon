1 Blessed is the man who does not walk according to the counsel of the wicked, and who does not stand in the way of the sinners, and who does not sit with the scorners.
2 For if he seeks his pleasure in the law of Yahweh, and meditates on that law day and night. 
3 Then he will be like a tree planted near the streams of water. It yields its fruit in its seasons, and its leaves do not wither. So whatever he does [with his whole heart] will prosper. 
4 But the wicked are not thus. For they are like the chaff which the wind drives away. 
5 Therefore the wicked will prevail against the judgment. Sinners will not endure in the assembly of the righteous. 
6 For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
