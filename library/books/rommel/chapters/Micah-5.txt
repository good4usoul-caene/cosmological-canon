1 Now gather your troops, O daughter of troops. They are besieging us, they are striking the judge of Israel on the cheek with a rod. 
2 And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah which is little among the thousands of Judah, out of you will come forth to me the one who will be the ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting. 
3 Therefore he will give them up until the time that she who is to bear gives birth, and the remnant of his brothers will return to the children of Israel. 
4 And he will stand, and will feed in the strength of Yahweh, in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God. And they will dwell, for now he will be exalted to the ends of the earth.

7 And the remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples like dew from Yahweh, like showers on the grass. They do not wait for man, they do not hope in the children of men. 
8 And the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, among many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest and like a young lion among the flocks of sheep. When he passes by, he tramples and tears in pieces, and no one can rescue. 
9 Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries, and all your enemies will be cut off [O Yahweh]. 
10 In that day, says Yahweh, I will cut off your horses from among you and destroy your chariots. 
11 I will cut off the cities of your land, and will overthrow all your strongholds. 
12 And I will cut off witchcrafts from your hand, and you will have no more soothsayers. 
13 I will cut off your graven images and your pillars from among you, and you will no longer worship the work of your hands. 
14 And I will cut off your groves from among you. So I will destroy your cities. 
15 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury on the nations that have not listened.
