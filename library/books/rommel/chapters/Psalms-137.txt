1 We sat by the rivers of Babylon [where we have been taken into captivity], and we wept there while remembering Zion.
2 And we had hung our harps there on the willows trees. 
3 And then those who had taken us captive asked us for songs. Our enemies asked us to entertain them by saying: Sing us some of the songs of Zion. 
4 How can we sing the songs of Yahweh in a foreign land. [How can we entertain those who have captured us with the songs of Yahweh] 
5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, then let my right hand forget me. [For we hope in the promises that Yahweh has made to his servant David]
6 If I do not remember you, if I do not think of Jerusalem whenever I am happy, then let my tongue cling to my palate. 
7 Remember the children of Edom, O Yahweh. For in the day of Jerusalem’s misfortune, they were saying: Raze it, raze it to its foundations. 
8 O Daughter of Babylon who deserves to be destroyed, we bless the one who will repay you for the evil that you have done to us. 
9 We bless the one who will seize your children to fling them and crush them against the stones.
