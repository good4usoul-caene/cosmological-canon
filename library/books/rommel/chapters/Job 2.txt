1 And on a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan also came among them to present himself before Yahweh. 
2 And Yahweh said to Satan, Where do you come from. And Satan answered Yahweh and said, From going backward and forward on the earth, and from walking on it. 
3 And Yahweh said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job. There is no one like him on earth. He is a just and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil. He remains firm in his integrity, while you move me against him to destroy him without reason. 
4 And Satan answered Yahweh and said, Skin for skin. Whatever a man has, he gives it for his life. 
5 But stretch out your hand now and touch his bones and his flesh, and I am sure that he will curse you to your face. 
6 And Yahweh said to Satan, Behold he is in your hands, but save his life. 
7 And Satan went away from the presence of Yahweh. Then he struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head. 
8 And Job took a potsherd to scrape himself. And he sat among the ashes. 
9 Then his wife said to him, Why do you remain firm in your integrity. Curse God and die. 
10 But Job said to him: You speak like a foolish woman. What. We receive good from the hand of God, and why should we not also receive evil. In all this, Job did not sin with his lips. 
11 Now three of Job’s friends have heard of all this misfortune that had befallen him, and they came every one from his own place. For they agreed together to come and lament with him, and to comfort him. It was Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. 
12 And when they looked at him from afar, they did not recognize him. So they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his garment, and sprinkled dust in the air above his head toward the heaven. 
13 And they sat on the ground with him seven days and seven nights, without saying a word to him. For they saw that his sorrow was very great.
