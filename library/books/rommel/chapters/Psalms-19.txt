1 A psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the expanse shows the work of his hands. 
2 Each new day tells more of the story, and each night reveals more about the knowledge of God. 
3 And these knowledge acquired through experience is not explained by a word or a speech, their voice is not heard [it is transmitted only by comprehension]. 
4 And their communication is experienced throughout all the earth, their teaching reaches the ends of the world. He has set a tabernacle there for the sun.
5 The sun comes out like a bridegroom out of his private room, and rejoices to run on its way like an athlete.
6 It rises at one end of the sky, and goes on its way to the other end. Nothing is continuously hidden from its warmth. 
7 The law of Yahweh is perfect, it converts the soul. The testimony of Yahweh is reliable, it makes the simple wise. 
8 The statutes of Yahweh are right, and they rejoice the heart. The commandments of Yahweh are pure, and they enlighten the eyes. 
9 The fear of Yahweh is clean, and it endures forever. The judgments of Yahweh are true, and they are all fair. 
10 They are more precious than gold, than much fine gold, and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. 
11 They make your servant circumspect, and there is a great reward for whoever keeps them. 
12 Who can discern all his errors. Forgive me those of which I am ignorant. 
13 Keep your servant from presumptuous sins. Let them not rule over me, and then I will be upright and clean from great sins.
14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Yahweh my strength and my redeemer.
