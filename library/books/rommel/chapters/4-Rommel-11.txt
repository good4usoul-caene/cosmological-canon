1 Theological vocabulary (Luke 1:31-33 - John 8:51), first part: Generalities.
2 Any opinion or explanation (Proverbs 18:2) is always from someone, and we should trust no one (Isaiah 2:22 - 1 Thessalonians 5:19-22).
3 In this biblical sentence (Proverbs 18:2) it is not the fact of wanting to reveal one's thoughts that is criticized but rather the possibility of doing so without being based on any conviction resulting from a preliminary analysis of at least one aspect of the problem (Romans 14:5).
4 For it must be understood that one who is motivated by the holy spirit cannot be a fool. 
5 And if someone knows absolutely nothing about a subject, is it impossible to have an intimate conviction without calmly listening to the different points of view available (Proverbs 12:15). 
6 Words and phrases may have different meanings when used in different sentences (Genesis 15:13-16 - Exodus 12:35-41 - John 8:33 - Genesis 2:1-3 - Leviticus 25:8-10 - Daniel 9:21-26). 
7 And the actual duration of the stay of the children of Israel in Egypt may be different (Exodus 6:16-20 - 12:40-41). Either because the count was made from the time Joseph was sold, or because after the miracles that were performed there to free the children of Jacob, the word Egypt is more generally used to designate a population or even a territory where beliefs are incompatible with the one true God. And in this latter case it is necessary to count from the moment of Isaac's birth, or from the moment when the promise was made to Abraham as indicated by the apostle Paul (Galatians 3:15-17). For Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed in the days of Abraham (Genesis 18:20-26) but their names continued to be used to designate peoples with similar practices (Deuteronomy 32:32 - Isaiah 1:1-2,9-10). 
8 Otherwise how to understand on the one hand that no misfortune happens to the just (Proverbs 12:21) when it is said that Job was just (Job 1). 
9 And on the other hand that misfortune often happens to the just who will always be delivered (Psalms 34:11-22) when John the Baptist is said to have had his head cut off (Luke 9:7-9). 
10 Thus it must be admitted that the righteous may undergo very difficult trials but will always see in each situation an opportunity to serve the creator through the spirit according to all the complex information that is accessible while the wicked cannot reach the fullness of the heart because he continually experiences desires that offend the spirit (Proverbs 12:21).
11 Moreover, the certain deliverance of the righteous (Psalms 34) does not necessarily concern physical life but will always be accomplished in eternal life, possibly anonymously (John 12:24-26). 
12 So we who are disciples of Jesus Christ are wise (Proverbs 8:1-21 - 1 Corinthians 1:30-31) but our wisdom is not that of the world (Proverbs 3:7 - Isaiah 5:21). 
13 A single reality can be described by several truths, in other words a single truth can have several facets (Exodus 20:11 - Deuteronomy 5:15 - Numbers 13:1-3 - Deuteronomy 1:19-24 - 1 Samuel 10:9-12 - 19:18-24). 
14 In addition, the notion of responsibility allows the free use of different names to designate the author of a single achievement (Luke 10:16). 
15 The author of the establishment of judges assigned to this task among the children of Israel (Exodus 18:13-27 - Deuteronomy 1:1-17 - 16:18-20). Or the authors of the losses that have occurred during a conflict (2 Samuel 21:15-22 - 1 Chronicles 20:4-8). Or the author of the making of the ark of testimony (Exodus 31:1-11 - 38:22 - 39:42-43 - Deuteronomy 10:3-5). Or the author of the writings of the ten words on the tablets of stone, the other two tablets that were not broken after the first two tablets had been broken (4 Rommel 6:13), for he who acts under the influence of the spirit of God performs the acts of God (Luke 3:21-22 - 1 Chronicles 28:19 - 2 Chronicles 20:14-15 - 24:19-21 - Judges 20:27-28). And also the authors of the death of Jesus of Nazareth (Luke 18:31-34 - John 18:28-32 - 19:6-11,12-16).
16 In the holy scriptures different realities are called by the same name only because of the particular connection between their contextual nature (Job 10:4 - 1 Samuel 16:6-7). [We can speak of Manasseh to designate all the individuals whose paternal genealogies contain this child of Jacob, and it is also possible to speak thus of Machir who is the first son of Manasseh (Joshua 17:1), and there is also Sodom and Gomorrah which were destroyed in the days of Abraham (Genesis 18:20-26) but their names continued to be used to designate peoples with similar practices (Deuteronomy 32:32 - Isaiah 1:1-2,9-10).]
17 As a first example, the word God which refers to a hidden power (Exodus 7:1) can indifferently refer to the author of all creation (Genesis 1:1), or to his only begotten Son who has a different identity (John 1:1-4 - 1 Timothy 2:5), or to his holy spirit who alone can secure us a place in eternal life (1 Chronicles 28:19 - 2 Chronicles 20:14-15 - 24:19-21 - Judges 20:27-28).  
18 Thus, an unchanging God announces the arrival of the messenger of a new covenant who is also called God (Malachi 3:1-6 - Isaiah 40:1-5,6-9 - John 1:1). 
19 As a second example, all those who cling to the holy spirit receive a firstborn position and obtain therefore an eternal inheritance (Exodus 4:22 - Psalms 89:26-28,35-37 - Jeremiah 31:9 - John 1:9). And Jesus of Nazareth is the first born par excellence (Psalms 45:6-7). 
20 As a third example, the word Israel sometimes refers to the twelve tribes who have come from Jacob and who are finally dispersed after Jesus of Nazareth (Exodus 12:47-51 - Leviticus 19:33-37 - 24:22 - Joshua 1 - Isaiah 56:1-8). And some other times it is all the Israel of God which contains more than Jacob (Genesis 17:1-5 - 32:28 - Joshua 14:14 - Micah 5:1-4 - Romans 9:6-8 - Ezekiel 47:21-23 - Romans 2:28-29). 
21 As a fourth example, the Levites of the New Covenant (Malachi 3:1-6 - Jeremiah 31:31-37) are no longer determined by the family tree (Deuteronomy 10:8-9 - 18:1-8 - Acts 4:31-37) but all imitators of the apostle Paul, who is himself from the tribe of Benjamin (Philippians 3:4-11), for whom nothing is forbidden except to have in the heart evil intentions in relation to strangers arbitrarily chosen in society (Exodus 19:5-6 - 1 Corinthians 9:14-19 - 11:1 - Luke 17:10). 
22 The apostle Paul uses all the information of the context in which he evolves and wants to create a form of school accordingly (1 Timothy 2:12 - Galatians 4:1-2 - 1 Corinthians 3:1-2 - Galatians 3:28) to teach people to move away from all forms of idolatry and to cling only to the holy spirit (Judges 4:1-10 - 2 Chronicles 34:18-28 - Isaiah 29:13 - John 13:34-35 - 1 Peter 1:22-25 - 2 Corinthians 10:3-6). The message that is taught is unique, it is the message of Jesus of Nazareth (3 Rommel 2:19-21).
23 As a fifth example the words life and death sometimes refer to the life and death of the physical body (Exodus 21:12-14 - Deuteronomy 32:48-52 - 2 Kings 20:1-3 - Philippians 2:27-30) and sometimes to eternal life and eternal death (Proverbs 8:32-36 - 14:32 - John 1:4 - Isaiah 57:1-2 - Ezekiel 18:25-27 - 33:11 - 1 John 5:12-13). 
24 As a sixth example the word father in the scriptures does not necessarily refer to blood relationship (Genesis 45:8-9 - Exodus 4:22 - Judges 17:10 - 18:19 - 2 Kings 6:21 - 8:9 - 16:7 - Psalms 45:16-17 - Luke 20:41-44). 
25 And the father of the true children of Israel (Malachi 1:1-3 - Romans 9:6-8) is the holy spirit whose best representative is Jesus of Nazareth (4 Rommel 4:16 - John 8:19-20 - 12:42-46 - 14:8-9). Everyone is born ignorant and after the new birth our new father is the holy spirit who is the God of Israel (John 3:1-8 - 8:38-41,42-44 - 16:25-30). 
26 As a seventh example the word Law refers to two separate things. It may be the particular pedagogy of Moses (Galatians 3:23-26 - 1 Corinthians 9:20-21) within which the hereditary tribe of Levi and the hereditary successors of Aaron have a particular role (Numbers 18). And they are the only ones authorized to receive whatever any Jew may wish to offer to God. 
27 Or it may be the timeless law of Christ (1 Corinthians 9:21) since no one needs to be a Jew or know Moses before understanding the meaning of the word steal (appropriating the possession of another).
28 As an eighth example there is a clear distinction between Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Leviticus 23:4-8) but the two are closely linked, so that over the centuries the name of one might have been used to designate the other (Ezekiel 45:21 - Luke 22:1,7-8 - John 13:1 - 19:14). 
29 In the sight of God the name of an entity is not some literal expression (Exodus 33:17 - Judges 6:31-32 - 7:1-2) but the abstract concept that this entity represents (Exodus 34:14). 
30 For communities have different languages that can designate the same reality by different words and sounds, since the different alphabets sometimes have nothing in common. 
31 And when God speaks of destroying a people, it is not necessarily a question of removing all the celestial bodies of the individuals who constitute that people (Numbers 24:14-25 - Ephesians 6:12) but the idolatrous belief systems which are the foundations of the organization of social life in these communities (Numbers 14:21 - Isaiah 11:9-10 - Micah 5:1-4 - Habakkuk 2:13-14 - Jeremiah 16:19-21 - 30:10-11). 
32 The Epistle of John (4 Rommel 2:59-61) teaches somewhere that only one thing is required (1 John 5:11-12,20-21), and elsewhere that it is actually two things (1 John 3:23) and perhaps more (1 John 2:3-4). 
33 These nuances are necessary because obedience to the holy spirit implies on the one hand the confidence that this obedience will give a place to our heavenly body. And on the other hand, there is a methodology to follow (1 John 2:20 - 1 Kings 3:5-12 - Proverbs 1:1 - 10:1 - 25:1 - Ecclesiastes 1:1 - 12:10-14).
34 To reject any form of idolatry but submit to the rules established in the surrounding society (Proverbs 24:21-23).
35 To obtain forgiveness for an offense by soliciting the actors concerned since this is the path indicated by the pedagogy of Moses (4 Rommel 7:19), and to practice justice and fairness when dealing with anyone even strangers (Proverbs 14:34 - 21:3-4).
36 To understand that we are connected to our achievements by the notion of responsibility (Proverbs 6:1-5). 
37 To analyze each situation before reacting (Proverbs 12:16 - 14:29 - 15:1 - 16:32 - 20:3).
38 To educate the youth because everyone comes into the world ignorant (Proverbs 3:11-12 - 13:24 - 22:6,15 - 23:12-21).
39 To stay focused on the goal (Proverbs 4:20-27). 
40 There is no possibility of retaining the discriminatory pedagogy of Moses (Romans 2:13 - Galatians 3:10 - 2 Peter 3:15-16) because it is a sin against the holy spirit who is the true God (Isaiah 54). 
41 Just as the writings of the prophet Jeremiah take place before the Babylonian captivity and could therefore concern events to occur before the arrival of the messenger of the new covenant mentioned in chapter 31, these writings of the apostle Paul (Romans 2:13 - Galatians 3:10) occur while the temple of the Jews, the workplace of the tribe of Levi and of the high priest direct descendant of Aaron, is still in operation (John 11:49-52). 
42 Whoever wants to be under the law of Moses must absolutely identify all members of the hereditary tribe of Levi and the lawful successors among the sons of Aaron (Leviticus 25:32-34 - Numbers 5), and additionally identify all the Jews of mankind according to their paternal tribes (Leviticus 25:23-31 - Numbers 36 - Deuteronomy 23:19-20).
43 Such a person is a real asshole and if he is not just an ignoramus who is content to do what his father or his mother or his neighbors or his brothers told him to do (2 Chronicles 21:1-5 - Judges 9:1-5 - 1 Kings 12:10 - Job 32:1-10 - 2 Chronicles 15:16-17 - 22:8-12 - 2 Kings 6:26-29,30-31 - Isaiah 2:22) then he is truly cursed (Galatians 3:10). 
44 Finally we must make the connection between Romans 2:12 and Romans 3:20-22. 
45 And it is legitimate to ask what are the commandments considered by the apostle James who is supposed to be a disciple of Jesus of Nazareth and also a Jew at the same time (Luke 11:52 - 1 John 2:18-21). 
46 For whoever keeps the whole law but sins against one commandment becomes guilty of all (James 2:10). Is anyone among you sick. Let him call the elders of the Church and let these elders pray for him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him. Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. For the fervent prayer of a righteous man is very useful (James 5:14-16). 
47 Some point out that Acts 3:22-23 is not identical to Deuteronomy 18:18-19 and they thus indicate that Moses does not announce the arrival of a particular prophet who will give the people new or different laws (Deuteronomy 4:1-2) but that he announces a continuous series of prophets who will only give warnings to the people on future difficulties without ever changing a law that will never change (Genesis 1:29 - 9:1-3 - Leviticus 11:1-4). 
48 However Moses never asked God to build a house with doors and windows (Ezekiel 44:1-5 - 46:1-3 - John 4:22) but only explained the plans for the construction of a movable work as the workplace of the high priest successor to Aaron, with the colors of the curtains and the arrangements of the altar of incense (Exodus 30:1-10) and of the altar of burnt offerings (Exodus 27:1-8).
49 And this teaching of Moses did not however survive forever but only during the nearly four hundred years which constitute the era judges (Judges 8:22-23 - Hosea 13:11 - Acts 7:44-53). 
50 Deuteronomy 30:11 could be paralleled with the fact that all the important characters in the scriptures, starting with Moses himself and king David as well, have offended God (Numbers 20:9-12 - 1 Kings 15:5).
