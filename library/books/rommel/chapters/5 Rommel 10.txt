1 Falsifications in the Bible, second part: The old testament. 
2 As I pointed out in the section 'The identity of God', the chronology that is exposed in the revelations of the holy spirit is not conceived from a human perspective.
3 And it may be thought that until today the body of Christ is that of a child who does not know how to reject the evil and choose the good.
4 For the holy writings still contain serious falsifications which I have highlighted previously, but not only.
5 Indeed, the interpretation of the events described in the prophecies is not necessarily trivial (Isaiah 7:13-15 - 2 Peter 1:20-21).
6 Like the gospel, the old testament scriptures are not necessarily spared by the enemies of God. 
7 Indeed, in some ancient translations of the Bible, the scripture Isaiah 7:14 contains the expression 'a virgin shall conceive', as is the case in the translation King James Version (KJV).
8 And in other translations more recent, this expression has become 'the young woman will become pregnant', as is the case with the translation Complete Jewish Bible (CJB). 
9 Whatever the reality, any falsifications in the old testament cannot call into question the message of the gospel, as I pointed out in the section 'Objective of the holy scriptures and the sacrifice of the man Jesus'. 
10 However, I want to emphasize that the authors of such a practice, if it were done on purpose, would be really foolish because by acting in this way, they would deny the kind that was distinguished by the holy writings of which they had been the guardians.
11 Because the God by whom they received this distinction told them that he is righteous and just, and that he chose them to be like him. 
12 Did I not write in the 'Overview' section that faith is about trusting no one.
