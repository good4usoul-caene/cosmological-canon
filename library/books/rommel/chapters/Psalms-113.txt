1 Praise Yahweh. Praise, you the servants of Yahweh. Praise the name of Yahweh. 
2 Blessed be the name of Yahweh from this time and forever. 
3 Let the name of Yahweh be praised from the rising of the sun to its going down. 
4 Yahweh is high above all nations, and his glory is above the heavens. 
5 Who is like Yahweh our God. He dwells in the high place. 
6 He looks down to see the things that are in the heavens and on the earth. 
7 He raises the needy from the dust, and lifts up the poor from the dunghill. 
8 In order to set him among the princes, among the nobles who are the beloveds of Yahweh. 
9 He builds the house of the barren woman who loves him [namely he gives her a legacy]. He makes her a joyful mother of children [who are either carnal or spiritual]. Praise Yahweh.
