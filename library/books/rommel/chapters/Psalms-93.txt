1 Yahweh reigns, and he is clothed with majesty. Yahweh is clothed with strength, with which he has girded himself. The world is established and will not be moved. 
2 Your throne has been established from everlasting, you have existed from everlasting. 
3 The floods have lifted up, O Yahweh. The floods have lifted up their voice. The floods lift up their roaring waves. 
4 But Yahweh is mighty in the heavenly places. He is more mighty than the noise of many waters, more mighty than the mighty waves of the sea.
5 Your testimonies are entirely true. May holiness become your house forever, O Yahweh.
