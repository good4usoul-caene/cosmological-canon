1 A psalm of David. Hear my voice when I cry out, O God. Preserve my life from the enemy whom I fear. 
2 Protect me from the plots of the wicked, from the tumult of the workers of iniquity. 
3 They sharpen their tongue like a sword, and they hurl their bitter words like arrows. 
4 Without having publicly acceptable justifications in their hearts, they shoot at those who have not offended them. They do not fear. 
5 They encourage themselves in their wickedness. They commune together to lay snares secretly, and they say: Who will see these things.
6 They have planned iniquity and they want to accomplish it. Each of them has this intention in his secret thoughts, in the depths of his heart.
7 But God will shoot an arrow at them unexpectedly, and they will be struck suddenly. 
8 Their tongue will make them stumble, and each of those who will be told of what has happened to them will shake his head in astonishment.
9 And thus all men will fear. They will declare the work of God, and will wisely consider of his doing. 
10 The righteous will rejoice in Yahweh and will trust in him. All those who are upright in heart will rejoice.
