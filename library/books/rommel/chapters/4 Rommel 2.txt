1 Motivation (John 6:29 - Proverbs 1:7), first part: Searching for the God of scientists. 
2 He created everything, the heavenly bodies and the earthly bodies, and he manifested himself to different people of different peoples and chose some to keep written records. 
3 He freed them from slavery under the guidance of Moses who gives the people laws to practice and prophecies. Obedience assures them a peaceful life and disobedience subjects them to servitude to other communities (Deuteronomy 4:25-31,32-40).
4 So much so that the good conscience of one of them towards a great king allows them to obtain permission to defend themselves in the book of Esther. 
5 And later comes someone who claims to be the door of the sheep and the light of the world. And his disciples say of the newcomer that he is the heir of everything, and that in fact he was there from the beginning.
6 Does a scientist have the right to seek the purpose of life through one's his specialty or through any source of information. 
7 Jean Thill: I think that these questions are not helpful to save your Soul. 
8 Answer: The words of truth are always paradoxical, Lao Tzu. 
9 Science does not establish all of the phenomena that occur in nature, but allows us to reject what is not consistent with a specific set of hypotheses. One cannot affirm that science is contrary to faith without having first clarified what this faith consists of, and my faith is not based on Adam and Eve and Paradise but rather on this proposition P, Truth is the light of men. 
10 This observation appeared to me while reading the gospels and the apostles, I would not have done it alone. And I interpret it in these other words: God is the notion of truth.
11 My proof of proposition P comes from an obvious paradox. Indeed, if there exists a theory, a system of hypotheses, that makes it possible to prove that P is false, then this demonstration of the falsity of P can be considered as the only lie that claims to enlighten men. 
12 A pagan imagines that a few little lies can serve just causes. The one who blasphemes is the one who falsifies the results or the interpretation of the process of constructing a physics experiment for the sole purpose of promoting a certain theory. Blaspheming is lying in the name of truth and I think that truth is a relative notion. 
13 Alexander Yurkin: When to me there were so many years as to you, I thought too that the truth is a relative concept, but there was it no so. There is such Ancient Greek logical paradox: ‘All Cretans lie, Cretan Brut has told’. The truth was told by Cretan Brut or he has told a lie? For 2,5 thousand years nobody could give the answer to this question. (Reference: Crete is the main Greek island on which there lived antique Greeks, and now there live modern Greeks.)  
14 Answer: I esteem Jesus of Nazareth. It is because of him and his apostles that I know that I must worship and serve the truth itself, the truth that is within me, and not the people who claim to possess it or the objects that are said to shelter it. 
15 a. If the Cretan citizen has not lied in relation to his relative truth, then he really thinks deeply that all Cretans lie. b. If the Cretan Brut has lied about his relative truth, then he deeply thinks inside himself that there may be Cretans who do not lie. Alexander I think that (a) leads to a contradiction while (b) is mathematically acceptable since the Cretan Brut is not God. My solution is therefore that Cretan Brut is a liar.
16 It could be argued that a paradox is logical in nature when it can be analyzed using the definition that truth is the conformity between what a person transmits and what that person actually knows. And that a paradox that is not of a logical nature is of a semantic nature.
17 This approach to truth is not a semantic theory of truth but rather a correspondence of truth with an idealist position. According to my approach, if I consider that a person is crazy then I must admit that this person can be wrong but cannot be a liar because, because of his madness, everything he transmits is consistent with his knowledge. 
18 This is a common practice in society when individuals declare that others are or are not responsible for the facts they produce. Indeed, even if a person tells the truth, he can only provide satisfactory answers, including silence, if he is asked the right questions. Thus, since a madman is never considered a liar in all human societies and is not held responsible for his actions, truth is a relative notion. 
19 Job spoke according to his heart (Job 6:1-10,25-30 - 7:11-16 - 9:15) and Elihu spoke according to his heart (Job 32:1-10 - 33:1-3). And despite their opposition, both were approved by the angel of God (Job 34:31-37 - 42:7). For the three friends of Job have simply made poetry without being truly imbued with the holy spirit, since they condemn him for a sin that they cannot identify (1 Rommel 1:33) while Elihu condemns him for an arrogant reaction. Nevertheless Elihu acted with the intention of comforting Job and in his way of doing so, he chose not to put himself completely in Job's place because the spirit of the Lord does not flourish in despair (Job 32:1-5 - 33:31-33 - 37:19 - 2 Chronicles 5:11-14 - 7:1-3) but rather in the search for improvement (Ecclesiastes 7:1-4). Job did not lose hope of meeting his God after his death (Job 19:25-29), but he preferred that this death take place as soon as possible because he did not want to endure the suffering any longer. And Job says that he has been righteous for as long as he can remember (Job 10:1-2 - 27:1-7), but he also recognizes that an ordinary person cannot have been completely righteous from birth (Job 13:26 - 14:4). 
20 And in addition, the Bible claims to describe the God of scientists (Proverbs 1:7 - John 1:3-4). 
21 If we are to trust only Christ (2 Peter 3:1-2 - Jeremiah 9:4-5) because we cannot identify with certainty those who truly love God (1 Kings 13:7-32 - Jeremiah 17:5-10). 
22 And that Christ's servants are to be seen only as examples to be followed (Philippians 3:15-21 - 1 Peter 5:1-5) and never as gods (Philippians 3:1-3 - 2 Peter 2:1-2 - 1 Thessalonians 5:21). 
23 Then why should anyone else be trusted. 
24 And here those who receive tithes are mortal men. But there it is one of whom it is witnessed that he is alive. And to put it bluntly, Levi who receives the tithe paid the tithe through Abraham. For he was still in the waist of his father when Melchizedek went to meet Abraham (Hebrews 7:8-10). Additionally, there were many priests because death prevented them from being permanent. But this man, because he remains eternally, has a priesthood that is not transferable (Hebrews 7:23-24). 
25 Obey those who have power over you [in matters of faith] and submit yourselves. For they watch over your souls as having to give account. Let it be so, so that they may do it with joy and not with grief because this is not profitable for you (Hebrews 13:17). 
26 Hell must not simply mean falling into oblivion, but also a permanent memory of what is not to be done and that has not been forgiven in some way (Jeremiah 20:10-11 - 23:33-40 - Ezekiel 13:1-9 - Zechariah 1:1-5,6 - John 8:21-24). Jeroboam is the first king of the kingdom of Israel which was created after the separation of the people of Israel into two kingdoms [Saul and David and Solomon are the only ones to have reigned over all of Jacob]. And the punishment of Jeroboam was carried out by Baasha the third king of the kingdom of Israel (1 Kings 14:1-9,10-16 - 15:25-30), and nevertheless the sin of Jeroboam remained throughout the existence of the kingdom of Israel (2 Kings 13:1-13 - 14:23-27 - 17:21-23 - Amos 4:1-5,6-13) and continues to exist in our memories. And during the whole time of the patience of God (2 Peter 3:15 - Ecclesiastes 8:11-13 - 4 Rommel 6:19-20), there have been people pleasing to God in the kingdom of Israel like king Jehu who created his own legacy in the form of the knowledge that we have of his behavior, despite the fact that he did not renounce the bad social organization that had been instituted by Jeroboam (1 Kings 12:26-31 - 2 Chronicles 11:1-12,13-17 - 13:1-12 - 2 Kings 10:28-31). But Jehu had also destroyed Ahaziah king of Judah and his family without being asked (Hosea 1:1-5 - 1 Rommel 3:20). And in those days of the patience of God regarding the memory of Jeroboam in the kingdom of Israel, Yahweh used Joash king of Israel to punish Amaziah, king of Judah concerning a personal transgression (2 Chronicles 25). And there were also good prophets [namely true prophets] in the kingdom of Israel like Elijah the Tishbite and Elisha, and others who have been mentioned, and all those who transmitted this knowledge to us, but Yahweh was not patient any longer because of the behavior of the people (Amos 5–8). Moreover, Manasseh has caused the destruction of the kingdom of Judah (2 Kings 21:1-16 - 24:1-4 - 2 Chronicles 33:1-9 - Jeremiah 15:1-4,5-7 - 19:1-5,6-15 - 32:29-35) but we also have the memory of his repentance (2 Chronicles 33:10-17). And it was the behavior of the people in the kingdom of Judah that did not encourage Yahweh to be patient any longer (Jeremiah 4:1-4,5-10 - 22:1-4,5-9 - 26:1-6,7-15 - 36:1-4,16-26 - 38:14-23 - 34:1-7,8-22 - 52:1-11 - Ezekiel 8:1-6,7-18 - 17:12-21 - 2 Chronicles 36:1-13,14-16 - 2 Kings 25:1-7 - The book of Jeremiah is not written in chronological order, but in thematic groupings - Jeremiah 36:32), as he was patient during the days of Josiah (2 Kings 22:11-20 - 23:25-27). Now it can be deduced from the scriptures that some of the people obey the word of Jeremiah every time that he repeats the same warnings, while there is a part of the people who choose the hardness of heart (Jeremiah 21:8-12 - 37:11-16 - 38:1-5,17-20). 
27 Similarly, in Galatians 5:3 'μαρτύρομαι δὲ πάλιν' cannot mean 'I attest' or 'I declare' but rather 'I protest' as indicated by some commentators who choose to assume that the word protest is used here to reinforce an argument and not to contest it. Yet it is evident that in the same document and the other letters associated with the apostles Paul and Peter and John, the teaching is that salvation comes only from faith in Christ (Galatians 5:6-12 - Acts 10:34-43 - 15:5-11) and not from the practice of the law namely the Moses' pedagogical law. 
28 But Christ does not forbid honoring the Levites while the physical temple which is their workplace is not yet destroyed (Deuteronomy 10:5-9 - 18:1-8 - Isaiah 42:3 - Luke 5:12-14 - 11:42 - Acts 6:1-7,8-15 - Luke 21:5-8 - 14:34-35 - 4 Rommel 12:50-52). 
29 Furthermore, the content of the Hebrew Bible is said to be identical to that of the Old Testament of the Protestant Bible and is different from that of the Old Testament of the Roman Catholic Church and that of the Old Testament of the Eastern Orthodox Church. 
30 And it is said that since the first centuries there have been discussions, in which honest and dishonest people might have participated, about the admissibility of the various books that constitute the current canon of the New Testament for their conformity to the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Either because of the content or because of the supposed authors. 
31 For example, some documents about the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth contain structural contradictions that concern more than just circumstantial details (2 Kings 24:8 - 2 Chronicles 36:9 - Genesis 46:27 - Exodus 1:5 - Acts 7:13-15 - Acts 9:1-9 - 22:1-11) having no consequence on the useful teachings that the reader is supposed to extract from the texts (2 Kings 2:23-25 - 1 Corinthians 10:6). And there are only a few instances in the Bible in which the books were written and successively copied through the centuries by ordinary men, and some of them were simply possessed by the holy spirit. 
32 This is the case of the Gospel of Thomas where we can notice the opposition between these two verses: (12) The disciples said to Jesus, We are aware that you will depart from us. Who will be our leader. And Jesus answered, No matter where you come from, it is to James the Just that you should go, for whose sake heaven and earth have come to exist. (77) Jesus said, It is I who am the light that presides over all. It is I who am the entirety. It is from me that the entirety has come, and to me that the entirety goes. Split a piece of wood, and I am inside. Lift a stone, and you will find me underneath. 
33 And we can also notice that unlike the Gospel of John (John 1:17-18), the message of the epistle of James is not consistent with the Hebrew Bible (Deuteronomy 13:1-4 - 32:39-40 - Judges 2:2-3,21-23) and that is why I reject his work (Luke 11:17-18). For James has said the following thing.
34 Let no man say when he is tempted, It is God who is tempting me. For God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one (James 1:13). 
35 Moreover, the main sacred text of Islam, the muslim religion, was revealed nearly six centuries after the story of Jesus of Nazareth according to what is said. And Jesus is mentioned there as a prophet sent to the Jewish people, and it is affirmed there that God cannot have sons and that it is a sin to worship as God a man or his mother who conceived him in virginity. 
36 O People of the Book. Do not go to extremes regarding your faith, and say nothing about Allah except the truth. The messiah Jesus, the son of Miriam, was no more than a messenger of Allah and the fulfilment of his word through Miriam, and a spirit created by a command from him. So believe in Allah and his messengers and do not say, Trinity. Stop, for your own good. Allah is only one God. Glory be to him, he is far above having a son. To him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as administrator of affairs (Quran 4:171). 
37 Those who say, Allah is the messiah, the son of Miriam. They have certainly fallen into disbelief. For the messiah himself said, O children of Israel, worship Allah my Lord and your Lord. Therefore, anyone who associates others with Allah in worship will surely be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their home will be the fire, and the wrongdoers will have no helpers. Those who say, Allah is one in the Trinity, they have certainly fallen into disbelief because there is only one God. If they continue to say this, those among them who disbelieve will be afflicted with a painful punishment. Will they not turn to Allah to repent and ask for his forgiveness? And Allah is forgiving and merciful. The Messiah the son of Miriam was only a messenger. Many messengers had come and gone before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth, and they both used to eat food. Look how clearly we explain the signs to them, and then look how they are deluded (Quran 5:72-75). 
38 And on Judgment Day Allah will say, O Jesus the son of Miriam. Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah. And he will answer, Glory be to You. How could I ever say what I had no right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly known it. You know what is hidden within me, but I do not know what is within you. Indeed, You alone are the knower of all unseen. I never told them anything except what you ordered me to say, Worship Allah my Lord and your Lord. And I was witness over them as long as I remained among them. But when you took me, you were the witness over them and you are a witness over all things. If you punish them, they belong to You after all. But if you forgive them, you are surely the Almighty, All-Wise (Quran 5:116-118). 
39 They say, The Most Compassionate has offspring. You have certainly made an outrageous claim, by which the heavens are about to burst, and the earth to split apart, and the mountains to crumble to pieces, in protest of attributing children to the Most Compassionate. It does not befit the majesty of the Most Compassionate to have children. There is none in the heavens or the earth who will not return to the Most Compassionate in full submission. Allah has never had any offspring, nor is there any god besides him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what he created, and they would have tried to dominate one another. Glorified is Allah above what they claim. He is the knower of the seen and unseen. Exalted is he above what they associate with him (Quran 19:88-93 - 23:91). 
40 My design is distinguished by the precise answers given to the following questions concerning the role that christianity can attribute to Jesus of Nazareth within judaism. 
41 If there is a creator and a divine will that we must know then what is the definition of a sin and how does someone obtain the forgiveness of his sins (Zechariah 8:16-17 - John 8:23-25). 
42 If Jesus of Nazareth is the king who announces the good news to all nations, and if the temple of God is his body, then who are the authorized intermediaries between him and his people. And how does he convey his instructions to his people (Zechariah 6:12-13 - John 2:18-22). 
43 Dora Simunovic: Let me tell you a (legendary, semi-mythical) story of the Spartan king Leonidas and the Persian emperor Xerxes. Persia was keen to invade Greece, including Sparta, and take over their control of the Eastern Mediterranean. Persia was a vastly larger empire, much richer and more powerful. But Spartans were famous warriors who lived in karst mountain mazes. It was going to be a difficult fight to invade Sparta, especially if the other Greek tribes joined in to help them. As it happened, the other Greek tribes did not join due to Persian political meddling. 
44 So Xerxes wrote one last letter to Leonidas, saying, “If we conquer your land by force, we will kill your sons, rape your women, main your soldiers, slaughter your cattle, burn your fields and sow them with salt. Give up your arms, and you will be spared this fate!” Leonidas replied, “If”. (This is how it is often remembered. In reality, Leonidas was even cooler than that. When Xerxes told him to give up his arms, Leonidas wrote back, “Come and take them”.).
45 I say the same to you. “If”. If the temple of god is the body of Jesus, etc. Well, why would we accept this? This is just another claim you are adding to a set of your other claims. Where is the evidence? Why do you believe this? What convinced you in the first place? 
46 But it goes beyond that, Rommel! How much do you know of the history of the Bible? I do not mean “Biblical history”, but the history of the actual book! Because, if you wish to claim that Mark and Matthew are fake, while Luke and John are better sources for the life of a historical Jesus, you are in disagreement with the vast majority of scholars whose job it is to know these things. 
47 With a minimum of research, you will find that Mark is, to the best of our knowledge, the oldest of the canonical gospels. It is also probably the oldest document about Jesus, with the possible exception of the Gospel of Phillip - which is not even in the Bible, just like the First and Second Apocalypse of Peter, Gospel of Mary Magdalene, Gospel of Judas, and countless others are not in the Bible. 
48 In the end, what is in that book, what is out of it, is almost totally arbitrary. I am glad that you agree there are clear moral absurdities in the Bible. However, I still don’t understand how they can be isolated to Judaism, Catholicism and/or Islam? Aren’t you just attacking your ideological / denominational opposition, while ignoring the contradictions in your own denomination? 
49 Besides, it is useless to try and convince me that Catholicism, Judaism and Islam are senseless. I already agree - but I include Protestantism, Hinduism, Mormonism, Shinto, and the others into this group as well. 
50 Answer: I am not an eyewitness to the events that would have occurred during the exodus under Moses, nor to the words and actions of Jesus of Nazareth about which there are different versions, nor to the exchanges between King Leonidas and Emperor Xerxes (I really enjoyed your presentation). 
51 What is interesting is to wonder, regardless of supposed historical facts, what teaching is scientifically acceptable or not. If during our exchange you voluntarily give me false information that I cannot verify, for example about the Gospel of Philip and its anteriority or its use by the other authors of the Gospels, I can logically only accept them if I find it useful for me because I have no reason to trust anyone when I have reached a certain maturity (Micah 7:5-6 - Isaiah 2:22). 
52 If I say that God exists and that righteousness is his only will in the lives of men, how have I offended knowledge or science. If my own denomination is described in this way, what contradictions do I ignore. 
53 When I realized, reading the writings of the apostles, that this is the only message they want to convey each in their own way (2 Peter 3:1-4), and that this is consistent with the structure of the Hebrew Bible, then I began to seek the face of Jesus-Christ in every excerpt of the Old Testament, after rejecting the writings that disfigure him in the canon of the New Testament (which included the Gospels according to Matthew and Mark). 
54 It is not a question of proving the historicity of the events presented but of observing that they are instructive for the understanding of God whose identity is defined independently of the biblical verses. 
55 Even in medicine, observation (the collection of data by a human subject, which can be used to propose theories) is an integral part of the scientific method, and this implicitly presupposes the righteousness and impartiality of the humans involved. Thus the Bible is simply one of the observations available to the investigators. 
56 If I cannot of course pronounce on the reality of the events described in these texts, I will not however trust the one who claims to have made research on the basis of his/her current knowledge and proved that Moses and the Exodus could not exist. I am satisfied to note that some communities have these scriptures in their traditions (Isaiah 43:9-13 - Romans 15:8-12). 
57 If I say that God exists and that righteousness and fairness are His only will in the life of men (Exodus 23:1-8 - Isaiah 28:17), then how have I offended knowledge. Why should I be ashamed of such monotheism (Galatians 3:23-26). 
58 Is it a matter of faith when it is stated that scientists have eternal life through their contributions to human knowledge (Luke 17:20-21 - 1 John 2:15-17).
59 (a) I argue that if a single book was to be retained among all those who make up the New Testament (including the Gospels), it would be the Epistle First John although the author chose nuances in these expressions so that subtly addressing those who already think that the Hebrew Bible was inspired by God. This epistle contains everything there is to know, provided you know how to bring together different verses in order to grasp their true meaning. And if any notion is not there it is simply because it is a useless notion (1 John 5:20-21). 
60 (b) I claim that if my goal is to reach eternal life, all I have to do is behave so that I always have a good conscience. It means having the conviction that a court of saints, which is aware of all the aspects that I know about the case, all the antecedents to my knowledge and my most intimate motivations, will not state any condemnation against me. If I think that I need to omit or falsify any aspect of the elements of which I am aware, then I must know that I am committing a sin. And this sin will not be forgiven if I have already realized from myself previously, with conviction, that it is those who do not commit such sins who obtain eternal life (1 John 3:3-7,20-21 - John 7:1-10,11-14 - Luke 11:37-41). 
61 (c) I claim that a person is a christian if that person behaves always and ever so as to want to reach eternal life, and that a person who has not yet been a christian can become a christian. This implies that I cannot judge a person about a case if I do not know everything that this person know about this case. And it also implies that a person who calls himself a christian is not necessarily a christian (1 John 2:3-6 - 4:1-3). 
62 More clearly, God is the abstract concept of truth, and his only begotten Son is the abstract concept of love of the general interest, and the holy spirit is the inner conviction of being well-intentioned not with respect to a particular person or community but with respect to the rest of the world. 
63 Ordinary men are incarnations of abstract concepts and are born in darkness, their light being the eternal life that is found in the only begotten Son of God whose first incarnation was Jesus of Nazareth, a character filled with the holy spirit from birth. [During the rebuilding of the house of Yahweh by the people who returned from the Babylonian captivity and from elsewhere, it happened that the high priest Joshua (Ezra 3:8-9 - 5:1-2 - Haggai 1:1-2 - Zechariah 6:9-12) has appeared in a vision of the prophet Zechariah (Zechariah 1:7-10 - 3:1-2), and one of the angels of Yahweh who has appeared in that vision has informed us that Joshua is not the only man who had appeared there (Zechariah 3:3-4,5-8). And it can happen that reality is indistinguishable from the dream (Acts 12:5-11 - 2 Corinthians 12:1-4), and some people may have the gift of seeing those who are already dead according to the flesh (1 Samuel 28:7-14).] 
64 Our actions are consistent with our intrinsic nature and necessarily depend on the information available. We survive by the impact we have had in the lives of others, as the abstract concept of which we have been the embodiment. [This is how the behavior of a person can be known before his existence in the physical world (4 Rommel 1:14 - Genesis 25:20-23 - Romans 9:11-13 - Malachi 1:1-3), and this is how Jesus can return to a place where he was before his existence in the physical world (Luke 1:35-37 - John 6:61-63).]
65 Everything that occurs in nature is a realization of God, and any action of men that is not done by the only begotten Son of God is by definition a work of the Devil. 
66 Finally, the separation between faith and science is neither in the definition of the Father and the Son and the holy spirit, nor in the definition of the notion of eternal life. 
67 But on the one hand in the assertion that these are the works of God the holy spirit that are established for eternity so as to preserve indefinitely through their consequences a useful and admirable trace in the perceptible universe (Proverbs 12:19 - 2 Chronicles 9:7-8 - Habakkuk 2:9-14 - Ephesians 2:8-10). 
68 And on the other hand in the consideration of the fact that, since the notion of sin is individual, our sins can influence the quality of the persecutions that will be imposed on them (Exodus 34:5-7 - Numbers 14:26-32,33-35), but the works of our offspring, whose existence involves not one person but at least a couple, are not directly attributed to us (1 Corinthians 3:15 - 7:7-9 - 1 Rommel 3:14-16,30-32).
