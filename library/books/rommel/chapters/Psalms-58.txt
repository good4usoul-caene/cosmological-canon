1 A psalm of David. Do you speak righteously, O congregation. Do you judge fairly, O sons of men. 
2 You prefer to plan wickedness in your heart, and your hands practise cruelty on the earth. 
3 The wicked are perverted from the womb. They go astray as soon as they are born by speaking lies [namely by acting insincerely]. 
4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent. They are like the deaf adder that closes its ear. 
5 This snake who does not hear the voice of the enchanter, even the voice of the most skilled sorcerer. [This snake who has the reputation of not being manipulated by the music of a charmer] 
6 Break their teeth in their mouths, O God. Break the jaws of the young lions, O Yahweh. 
7 Let them melt away like flowing waters. Let them shoot only blunt arrows. 
8 Let them be like a snail that melts and perish, or like a stillborn baby who will never see the sun.
9 He will sweep them away in his anger as by a whirlwind, the green ones as well as the burning ones, before your pots feel the heat of the thorns. 
10 The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance. He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
11 And men will say: Surely the righteous produces fruits [that last and are useful], undoubtedly there is a God who judges on earth.
