1 When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister and said to Jacob, Give me children or I die. 
2 Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, Am I in God's place, who prevents you from being fruitful. 
3 And She said, Behold my servant Bilhah. Go to her, that she may give birth on my knees, and that through her I may also have sons. 
4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife, and Jacob went to her. 
5 And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. 
6 And Rachel said, God has given me justice, and has heard my voice, and has given me a son. Therefore she called him Dan. 
7 Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. 
8 And Rachel said, I wrestled divinely with my sister and I prevailed. And she called his name Naphtali. 
9 Leah, seeing that she had ceased to bear children, took Zilpah her handmaid and gave her to Jacob as his wife. 
10 And Zilpah, Leah's servant, bore Jacob a son. 
11 And Leah said, What happiness. And she called his name Gad. 
12 And Zilpah, Leah's servant, bore Jacob a second son. 
13 And Leah said, How happy I am, because the girls will call me happy. And she called his name Asher. 
14 Reuben went out at the time of the wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the fields. He brought them to Leah his mother. Then Rachel said to Leah, Please give me some of your son's mandrakes. 
15 She answered him, Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband, that you also take my son's mandrakes. And Rachel said, Well, he will sleep with you tonight for your son's mandrakes. 
16 In the evening, as Jacob returned from the fields, Leah went out to meet him. And she said, It is to me that you will come, for I bought you for my son's mandrakes. And he slept with her that night. 
17 And God heard Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
18 And Leah said, God gave me my reward because I gave my handmaid to my husband. And she called his name Issachar. 
19 And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob a sixth son. 
20 And Leah said, God has given me a beautiful gift. This time my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons. And she called his name Zebulun. 
21 Then she bore a daughter, and named her Dina. 
22 And God remembered Rachel, and God heard her and made her fruitful. 
23 She conceived and bore a son, and she said, God has removed my disgrace. 
24 And she called his name Joseph, saying, May Yahweh add another son to me. 
25 When Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Let me go, so that I can go home, to my country. 
26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and I will go. For you know what service I have done for you. 
27 And Laban said to him, May I find grace in your eyes. I see clearly that Yahweh has blessed me because of you. 
28 Set your salary for me, and I will give it to you. 
29 Jacob said to him, You know how I have served you, and what has become of your flock with me. 
30 For the little that you had before me has greatly increased, and Yahweh has blessed you in my footsteps. Now when will I also work for my own house. 
31 And Laban said, What will I give you. And Jacob answered, You will not give me anything. If you agree to what I am going to tell you, I will still feed your flock and I will look after them. 
32 Today I will go through all your flock. And I will set apart every speckled and inlaid one among the sheep, and every black lamb, and among the goats everything that is speckled and inlaid. This will be my salary. 
33 My righteousness will answer for me tomorrow, when you will come to see my salary. All that is not speckled and inlaid among the goats, and black among the lambs, it will be theft on my part. 
34 And Laban said, Well, let it be according to your word. 
35 That same day Laban set apart the striped and inlaid male goats, all the striped and inlaid female goats, every one that had white on it. And everything that was black among the lambs. And he placed them in the hands of his sons. 
36 Then he put the space of three days' journey between himself and Jacob. And Jacob shepherded the rest of Laban's flock. 
37 And Jacob took green branches of poplar, almond and plane tree. And he peeled off white strips, exposing the white that was on the branches. 
38 Then he placed the branches, which he had peeled, in the gutters, in the watering troughs, under the eyes of the sheep who came to drink. So that they conceived when they come to drink. 
39 And the flocks came into heat near the branches, and the flocks brought forth striped, speckled and inlaid ones. 
40 And Jacob separated the lambs, and put together the striped and the black in Laban's flock. Thus he made separate flocks for himself, which he did not unite with the flock of Laban. 
41 Whenever the strongest of the herd was in heat, Jacob placed the branches in the troughs in front of the flock, so that they came into heat near the branches. 
42 When the flock were weak, he did not place them, so that the weak were for Laban and the strong for Jacob. 
43 This man became richer and richer. He had livestock in abundance, and maids and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
