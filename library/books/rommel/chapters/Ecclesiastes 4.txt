1 And then I have considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the oppressed weep and there is no one to comfort them. They have no comforter, and there is power in the hand of their oppressors. 
2 And I have thought that the dead who are already dead are happier than some of the living ones who are still alive. 
3 And I have also thought that those who are happiest are those who have not yet existed, since they have not seen the evil works that are done under the sun.
4 And I have seen that every work and every skilled work causes the jealousy of a man toward his neighbor. This also is vanity and the pursuit of the wind. 
5 The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh [since he destroys his soul by the way in which he obtains his food]. 
6 For it is better to have one hand full of riches obtained honestly than to have the two hands full of riches obtained by a dishonest work. 
7 Now I have seen another vanity under the sun. 
8 There is a man who is alone and has no companion, and has neither son nor brother. Nevertheless his labor has no end, for his eyes are not satisfied with riches. And he does not ask himself, For whom do I labor and deprive my soul of any good company. This also is vanity, and it is an evil labor. 
9 Two are better than one, because they can hope a good reward for their labor. 
10 For if one falls then the other can lift up his companion. But woe to him who is alone when he falls, for there is no other to lift him up. 
11 Likewise, if two sleep together then they will be warm. But how can he who is alone be warm.
12 And a person may overcome the one who is alone, but two persons may withstand an enemy. And three persons can even be stronger since three cords that are woven together to make one is not quickly broken.
