1 A psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O Yahweh. Be attentive to my supplication. Answer me in your faithfulness and in your righteousness. 
2 Do not enter into judgment with your servant. For there is no one alive who is righteous in your sight. 
3 The enemy pursues my soul, he has trampled down my life to the ground. He has caused me to dwell in darkness, like those who have been dead for a long time. 
4 My spirit is crushed within me, and my heart is amazed within me. 
5 I remember the days of old, and I meditate on all your doings. I ponder the work of your hands. 
6 I stretch out my hands to you, my soul desires you like a thirsty land desires rain. Pause. 
7 Hasten to answer me, O Yahweh, for my spirit faints. Do not hide your face from me, lest I become like those who go down into the pit. 
8 Keep me alive until morning so that I may continue to contemplate the work of your hands, for I trust in you. Make me know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to you. 
9 Preserve me from my enemies, O Yahweh. For I take refuge in you. 
10 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Let your good spirit lead me in the right way. 
11 Refresh me for the sake of your name, O Yahweh. Bring my soul out of trouble because of your righteousness. 
12 Free me from my enemies because of your lovingkindness. Punish all those who seek my soul, for I am your servant.
