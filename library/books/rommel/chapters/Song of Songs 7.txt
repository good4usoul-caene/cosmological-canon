1 Your feet in your shoes are so beautiful, O you the daughter of the prince. The curves of your thighs are like those of jewellery, your body is the work of the hand of a skillful artist. 
2 Your navel is similar to a round goblet that does not lack wine. Your belly is like a heap of wheat surrounded by lilies. 
3 Your two breasts are like two fawns that are twins. 
4 Your neck is like a tower of ivory. Your eyes are like the fishpools of Heshbon which are near the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus. 
5 Your head is lifted up like Carmel, and the hair of your head is like purple. Your whole hair is like a prison which is so pleasant that only kings deserve to be held captive there. 
6 You are so beautiful and so pleasant, O my love [my bride]. You are a delight. 
7 Your appearance is like that of a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters of fruit. 
8 And I say to myself: I will climb up this palm tree, and I will grasp its branches. Surely your breasts are like clusters of grapes, and the smell of your breath is like that of apples, and your mouth is like the best wine. 
9 May that wine go straight to my beloved [my bridegroom], and slide on the lips of those who are asleep [among the brides of my bridegroom].
10 I belong to my beloved [my bridegroom], and his desire is toward me. 
11 Come, my beloved. Let us go out into the fields, let us spend the night in the villages. 
12 And we will go to the vineyards in the morning in order to see if the vine has budded the little grapes, and if the pomegranates have flourished. And I will give you my love there. 
13 The mandrakes spread their fragrance, and there are all kinds of sweet things at our doors, new and old. I have kept them for you, O my beloved [my bridegroom].
