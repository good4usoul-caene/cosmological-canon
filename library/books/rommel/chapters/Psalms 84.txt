1 A psalm of the sons of Korah. How amiable is your dwelling, O Yahweh the God of armies. 
2 My soul yearns and faints for the courtyards of Yahweh. My heart and my flesh desire to rejoice in the living God. 
3 As the sparrow looks for a house, and the swallow looks for a nest to lay her young, thus my soul looks for your altar. O Yahweh the God of armies, my king and my God. 
4 Those who dwell in your house are blessed, since they can praise you continuously. Pause. 
5 Blessed is the man who seeks his strength in you [that is to say the one who has put his trust in you]. His heart longs for the paths to your house. 
6 They come through the valley of Baca, which God has turned into a place of springs and which is covered with blessing by the rains. 
7 Their strength increases as they march, and they come in order to stand before God in Zion. 
8 Hear my prayer, O Yahweh the God of armies. Listen to me, you the God of Jacob. Pause. 
9 Look at the face of your anointed [our king], O God our shield. 
10 Better is one day in your courtyards than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper of the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
11 For Yahweh God is our sun and our shield. Yahweh will give grace and glory to those who love him, he will provide all that is necessary for the triumph of those who walk uprightly. 
12 Blessed is the man who trusts in you, O Yahweh the God of armies.
