1 Objective of the holy scriptures and the sacrifice of the man Jesus.
2 The apostle Paul says that the purpose of the scriptures is to prepare the reader for the trials of life (2 Timothy 3:16-17 - Romans 15:4 - 1 Corinthians 10:11). 
3 It should be noted that the scriptures can be categorized as follows: the period of creation extends from the creation of heaven to that of the Garden of Eden. And the period of the patriarchs extends from Adam and Eve to Moses. And the period of the law and the prophets extends from Moses to Zechariah. [I said Zechariah because of the words of Jesus who spoke of a certain Zechariah in Luke 11:47-51, but I could also have said Malachi who seems to be the last prophet to have left a written revelation in the Hebrew Bible, and it may seem more appropriate to say John the Baptist who is the last major prophet to have lived before the final revelation of Jesus Christ.] 
4 And the last hour, or the end of the centuries, or the coming century, is the period that extends from the coming of the Just with his messenger and his apostles (John the Baptist - Jesus - Paul - Peter - John) until the second advent.
5 From a qualitative point of view, we can distinguish the generation of prophets stretching from Adam to Jesus, and the generation of the last hour, which begins with the introduction of the holy spirit into the world, and which will end at the second advent.
6 If all the scriptures come from a particular people, and are expressed in a particular language, it is legitimate to ask why other peoples should be interested in it with confidence. 
7 It must be noted that God has been able to manifest himself in different ways to other peoples of the earth, because by definition the law is addressed to those who have not naturally received the gift of discerning by themselves the way of Justice.
8 Indeed, God in whom there is no injustice did not choose the people of the Hebrews to testify that he makes a difference between the souls he created in his image.
9 But he chose them to reach those to whom he has not give the ability to find him by other means (1 Timothy 1:8-11).
10 God hid his identity and that of his only begotten Son to the writers of the old testament.
11 He was called in different ways (YHWH - God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob - Lord).
12 And he scrambled the tracks by addressing the prophets through angels represented in their visions from a human perspective. 
13 Thus, the descendants of Abraham according to the flesh could have imagined that their God belonged to them and was locatable in space and time (Genesis 28:10-22).
14 And they maintained the tradition of genealogies according to the will of God. 
15 But in reality the promises of the scriptures concern all the righteous of all nations (1 John 2:29 - Ephesians 3:3-6 - 1 Timothy 1:3-4 - Titus 3:9). 
16 In declaring himself apostle of the Gentiles several times, Paul encouraged the translations of his writings which are sufficient to understand what is to be understood, without being disturbed by falsifications which the enemies of the gospel may introduce elsewhere (2 Timothy 3:14-15). 
17 The purpose of the scriptures, therefore, is to convince those who are to be convinced by this means. Because it is enough to say few things to certain people so that they understand what is essential (Romans 10:17).
18 Thus, God raised men among the Hebrews to fulfill his purpose (Romans 10:14). God has therefore chosen Abraham to bring forth through his flesh a people through which he will state the laws that lead to the righteousness of the heart, which is the righteousness of God. 
19 But laws clearly stated in this way constitute a curse because they are necessarily incomplete. 
20 For example, based on the ten commandments, if a Hebrew is attacked on a sabbath by someone who wants to make war on him then must he defend himself and disobey the law or must he obey the law and let oneself be slaughtered so as not to have sin.
21 Thus Hebrews who are righteous in their hearts can be guilty according to the law, and deeply dishonest Hebrews can use the letter of the law to do criminal acts without God being able to convict them as guilty, for example by letting a patient die rather than performing an operation on the sabbath. 
22 Thus, all those who were under the law were sinners, either with respect to the law for those who wanted to be righteous or with respect to justice for those who wanted to obey the law (1 John 4:10 - 1 Timothy 1:15 - Galatians 3:22 - Romans 11:32-36). [When Jesus of Nazareth performed miracles on the sabbath days, those who approved him acted well according to their point of view, since Jesus was doing good to people who were suffering, and those who condemned Jesus acted well according to their own point of view, since they had the desire to sanctify the sabbath day as it was commanded to them in the law given by Moses. It can be noted that two different reasons have been stated to justify the commandment concerning the sabbath day (Exodus 20:8-11 - Deuteronomy 5:12-15).]
23 Since the law itself is a curse simply because of its existence, the necessary end of the law is marked by the fact that it is used to justify the murder of the man Jesus who has always been absolutely irreproachable according to justice of the heart, and therefore pleasing to God from his birth through a virgin girl to his crucifixion. 
24 And the apostles confirm this reality (John 5:18 - 1 Peter 2:22-25). 
25 It is the law given by God which is the exact justification of the death of a person whose guilt cannot be recognized in any of the actions he has practiced throughout his life. And this injustice provoked by the law is an act of jurisprudence that makes the law condemnable before God. 
26 So God stops using the law to judge the Hebrews who were under this law, and he gives justice to the man Jesus by raising him from the dead (1 John 4:9). 
27 Since it was God who had enunciated this cursed law, the punishment fell on his own son, who is not the son of a man (Galatians 3:13-14). 
28 This whole story is about the people who received the law (Romans 3:19-20). 
29 As soon as the law becomes condemnable before God, the new tool for the judgment of the world is the tool that was in the beginning, the tool that was used before the coming of the law by Moses namely the justice of the heart (Galatians 5:13-14 - Romans 13:8). 
30 The scripture however said that the gospel has been also announced to the dead. Perhaps this is a way of informing us that some of the dead, since Abel, are being sent back to the world so that they can reach the circumcision of their hearts, so that all those who have been predestined will find themselves on the right side on the day of judgment. 
31 I think that in the day of judgment all souls will leave their body envelopes but some will inherit eternal shame, and others will inherit eternal life by constituting what was good in Adam the first man because truth cannot exist without lies but truth can be separated from lying.
32 And because the gospel teaches us that the only begotten Son of truth is the love of the general interest who is Christ (1 Peter 3:18-19 - 4:6 - 1 Corinthians 15:51-53).
33 What has changed from the beginning, what in which the law has been useful, is that the people are now educated about the nature of God and the purpose of life.
34 They are instructed by all those who announce and distribute the word of God in all nations, to the ends of the earth (Romans 15:8-12 - Luke 16:27-31). 
35 The righteousness of the heart is simply fulfilled by the ten commandments among which the four that specify concrete actions (and not thoughts) must be mixed with the notion of love. 
36 All souls have the same price before God (Romans 3:21-24 - Galatians 4:4-5 - Galatians 5:1 - Ephesians 2:13-18). 
37 So if everyone is justified only by the justice of his heart then in a certain sense everyone is Jewish (Romans 2:28-29 - Romans 3:1-3).
38 Personally, I think that those who received the circumcision of the flesh already have their advantage, and that the law and Moses were for the Hebrews what Paul and his epistles were for the Gentiles.
39 The goal of these two men was to inculcate the beginnings of wisdom in their audiences (2 Corinthians 3:14-17 - Galatians 3:23-25 - Colossians 2:17 - 1 Corinthians 2:6-8,14-16 - Isaiah 28:23-29). 
40 It is permissible and recommended not to abide by the ten commandments in certain situations, and this fact can already be seen in the laws given by Moses as I mentioned in the section 'The humor of the holy scriptures' (John 5:39-40,41-47). 
41 And we know that the just will live by faith (Habakkuk 2:4). And there is no faith in the righteousness of the heart where there is the law (Galatians 3:10-11,29).
42 The notion of posterity according to God does not come from the bonds of the flesh but links of the spirit. 
43 We are the posterity of all those who lived before us and whom we regard as models (Genesis 18:18-19 - Ezekiel 33:23-29 - Galatians 3:6-9) and it is in this way that the Christ of God is destined to have children (Psalms 45:6-7,16-17). [Psalms 45 concerns Solomon but not only since a message that glorifies the spirit of justice is valid for all the holy prophets of God, and is more fully applicable to Jesus of Nazareth who is the prophet par excellence. And we can see that ordinary people are called gods in Psalms 82.]
44 The cornerstone that the builders have rejected is the man Jesus. But the stumbling block and the rock of scandal on which many stumble and break, are entwined and caught, it is Christ Jesus the only begotten Son of God (1 Peter 2:6-8 - Romans 9:6-8). 
45 What is therefore asked of each one is to love and seek the truth without any idolatry in the heart, and to seek the general interest (either by giving one's life or by keeping it) without hating whoever it is otherwise one runs into the stumbling block (Leviticus 19:11-18 - Micah 6:6-8). 
46 God allows and recommends that the ten commandments be ignored to one who can expose his actions in a human court, without any falsification of any aspect of the facts, with the conviction of being recognized as being just (John 20:22-23 - 1 John 1:5-7 - Genesis 9:5). 
47 This is how Jesus sometimes speaks of himself as the only begotten Son of God (John 5:26-27,30), and it may be noted that Paul himself asks believers to apply righteousness among them (1 Corinthians 5:1-5 - 6:1-3).
48 Thus, all things are permitted to him who acts in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 
49 It is in the name of the only begotten Son of God that Lot has proposed to the men of his city to have fun with his virgin daughters rather than to kill visitors (Genesis 19:5-8). 
50 It is in the name of the only begotten Son of God that the daughters of Lot chose to give birth with their father rather than disappear with him in an isolated region (Genesis 19:31-32).
51 Because he could not have the intention of liberating the Hebrew people by doing so, it is in the name of the only begotten Son of God that Moses has attacked a cruel Egyptian (Exodus 2:11-12). 
52 It is in the name of the only begotten Son of God that David chose to consume what the law of God only reserved for the priests (1 Samuel 21:3-6). 
53 This freedom to be well intentioned constitutes the message of the gospel and the substance of the pedagogical law of Moses (Acts 7:51 - John 1:17 - Isaiah 28:8-16).
