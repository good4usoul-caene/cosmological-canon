1 A psalm. A song made at the dedication of the house of David. I will glorify you, O Yahweh. For you have exalted me, you did not want my enemies to continuously rejoice over me. 
2 O Yahweh my God, I have cried to you and you have restored me. 
3 You have brought my soul up from the grave, O Yahweh. You have revived me from those who go down to the pit. 
4 Sing praises to Yahweh, you his saints [that is to say anyone who obeys him]. Give thanks to the remembrance of his holiness [that is to say, the knowledge of his way of acting].
5 For his anger lasts for a moment, but his mercy give life [his mercy lasts forever]. Weeping can endure for the night, but the consolation comes in the morning.
6 When I was thriving, I thought that no more difficulties would arise in my life. 
7 For you had caused my mountain to stand strong by your goodness, O Yahweh. But you did hide your face after that, and I was troubled. 
8 Therefore I cried to you, O Yahweh. I implored my Lord. 
9 What advantage is there in my blood if you bring me down to the pit now. Will the dust praise you among the living or declare your truth. 
10 Hear, O Yahweh, and have mercy on me. For you are my helper, O Yahweh. 
11 And after that you turned my lamentation into joy. You loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness. 
12 Therefore my tongue will praise you continuously. I will praise you forever, O Yahweh my God.
