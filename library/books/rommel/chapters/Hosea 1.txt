1 The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah [also called Azariah], and Jotham, and Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. 
2 The first time that Yahweh spoke to Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea: Go, take a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom. For the land has committed a great whoredom after they have turned away from Yahweh. 
3 So Hosea went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim. And she conceived, and bore him a son. 
4 And Yahweh said to Hosea: Call his name Jezreel. For yet a little while, and I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed in Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. [Now Jehu king of Israel had done what was asked of him concerning the legacy of Ahab king of Israel, but Jehu had also destroyed Ahaziah king of Judah and his family without being asked.] 
5 In that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. 
6 And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And Yahweh said to Hosea: Call her name Lo-ruhamah. For I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel, and I will utterly take them away. 
7 But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and I will save them by Yahweh their God. I will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen. 
8 Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. 
9 And Yahweh said: Call his name Lo-ammi. For you are not my people, and I am not your God. 
10 Nevertheless the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered. And in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people', it will be said to them, 'You are the children of the living God'. 
11 Then the children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and will appoint themselves one head, and will go forth out of the land. For the day of Jezreel will be great.
