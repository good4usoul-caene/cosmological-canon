1 A Prayer of David. Incline your ear, O Yahweh, and answer me. For I am poor and needy. 
2 Preserve my soul, for I am godly. Save your servant who trusts in you, O my God. 
3 Have mercy on me, O Lord. For I cry to you continuously. 
4 Rejoice the soul of your servant. For I have lifted up my soul to you, O Lord. 
5 For you are good and merciful, O Lord. You are full of goodness to all those who call on you. 
6 Give ear to my prayer, O Yahweh. Listen to the voice of my supplications. 
7 I call on you in the day of my distress, because you hear me.
8 There is no one like you among the gods, O Lord. And there is no one wo can perform the likeness of your works. 
9 All the nations will come and worship before you, O Lord. They will exalt your name, because you are the one who has created them. 
10 For you are great, and you do wondrous things. You alone are God. 
11 Teach me your ways so that I may walk in your truth, O Yahweh. Prepare my heart so that I may fear your name. 
12 I will praise you with all my heart, O Lord my God. Yes, I will exalt your name forever. 
13 For your lovingkindness is great toward me, and you have delivered my soul from the depths of the grave. 
14 The proud have risen up against me, O God. A company of violent men have sought my soul, and have not cared for your will. 
15 But you are a merciful and gracious God, O Lord. You are slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth. 
16 Look at me and have mercy on me. Give your strength to your servant, and save the son of your handmaid. 
17 Show me a sign of your goodness, and let those who hate me see it. And thus they will be ashamed because you have helped me and comforted me, O Yahweh.
