1 A psalm of David. I have put my trust in Yahweh. Therefore how can you say to my soul: Flee to your mountain like a bird.
2 For lo, the wicked bend their bow, They make ready their arrow on the string, to secretly shoot at the one who has an upright heart. 
3 When the foundations of justice are overthrown, what can the righteous do. 
4 Yahweh is in his holy temple, the throne of Yahweh is in the heaven. His eyes consider everything, his eyelids probe the children of men. 
5 Yahweh will probe the righteous. But his soul hates the wicked, the one who rejoices in iniquity. 
6 He will rain snares on the wicked. Fire, sulfur and burning wind will be the portion of their cup. 
7 For Yahweh is righteous, he loves righteousness. The upright will behold his face.
