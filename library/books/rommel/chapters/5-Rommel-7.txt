1 The humor of the holy scriptures. 
2 To renounce all that I possess (to be poor) means to possess only to render service to everyone in general and to no one in particular (Luke 6:20 - 12:33-34 - 14:33 - 4 Rommel 8:15).  
3 The believer who acts without love can crush the only begotten Son of God without touching him (Luke 8:43-48 - 1 Corinthians 13:3).
4 Moreover, about the exchange between Jesus and the rich man (Luke 18:18-24), it is obvious that he expresses himself with mischief because he himself does not respect the ten commandments. 
5 And not only does he not respect them, but in addition he is given the mission to encourage others not to respect them.
6 Indeed, he works on the sabbath which is forbidden by the fourth commandment, by asking a clear question to his interlocutors (Luke 6:6-11). 
7 Furthermore, he asks his interlocutors to remember that David stole (Luke 6:1-5) and this is forbidden by the eighth commandment. 
8 And we can remember for ourselves that David also killed (1 Samuel 17:49) and this is forbidden the sixth commandment. 
9 And we can also remember that Moses himself asked to kill (Exodus 21:12-14 - Deuteronomy 19:1-6,11-13 - Numbers 35:30-31 - Deuteronomy 19:15).
10 The Apostle Paul confirms Jesus’ sense of humor by stating that the ten commandments, which the man Jesus did not respect, are fulfilled by the one commandment given by the man Jesus (Romans 13:9-10). 
11 This complicity between Christ and his apostle also appears when the man Jesus speaks (Luke 16:14-18). 
12 It is with mischief that he wants to signify to the greedy pharisees that they need Christ not to be guilty before God, in other words it is through Christ that it is possible not to respect the seventh commandment while being without sin before God. 
13 The usual wording being that the Lord's cross or his precious blood cleanses us from all sin. 
14 To convince oneself of this reality, it suffices to remark that Paul states that the Lord commands two believers who are married not to separate (1 Corinthians 7:10-11).
15 However, he also adds that if one of the spouses behaves like a non-believer and imposes separation then the other spouse is no longer bonded (1 Corinthians 7:12-15) and therefore can remarry without offending the Lord. 
16 And after all these indirect remarks about the possibility of transgressing one of the four commandments of actions.
17 For among the ten commandments, the five that concern only the thoughts and intentions must be rigorously respected in all circumstances, so that they determine the limits of the unique ambiguous commandment which is formulated with a promise because God is also the true father of each (2 Chronicles 15:16-17).
18 The man Jesus asks his interlocutors whether it is possible that David was not aware of the fifth commandment (Luke 20:41-44). 
19 This particular humor of the man Jesus can also be seen in the Gospel of John. In fact, he first remarks that he came to sacrifice himself (John 4:31-34).
20 And then he himself suggests to his interlocutors to use the law of Moses to condemn him to death (John 7:17-24). 
21 It is true that this excerpt can also be interpreted by saying that Jesus informs his interlocutors that they should not condemn him when he does not respect the fourth commandment, because they may find themselves in a situation where they must also disobey to this commandment.
22 For example, when a circumcision is to be performed on the eighth day (Genesis 17:12 - 4 Rommel 6:19).
23 And the apostle Paul also does not lack humor (Galatians 3:27 - Romans 6:3-4 - 1 Corinthians 15:29 - 3:18 - 2 Corinthians 12:15-16 - 1 Corinthians 9:19-23 - 1 Timothy 2:5-8). 
24 And though it is true that those who were not created in Christ by God do not have eternal life, he says more about the prayer (Galatians 1:15-17 - Ephesians 2:10 - 6:19-20 - Colossians 4:2-4). 
25 Like Paul, the apostle John shares the same complicity with his master when he testifies to us that we will be heard if we pray to God to grant eternal life to a person who has never committed the one unforgivable sin, as I exposed it in the section 'Figures of rhetoric, Prayer' (5 Rommel 12:19-24).
26 It appears that Peter is the only apostle who has remained serious (2 Peter 3:15-16).
27 And we know, in fact, that the two epistles of Peter and the epistle of John are addressed to believers who already have the wisdom of the law (Galatians 2:7-10). 
28 The apostles were not saddened by the trials that life imposed on them (Acts 5:41) as they indeed have the right to be happy and to make known it, because they saw the first risen one who ascend to heaven (John 16:19-23). 
29 Thus, the man Jesus speaks mischievously because he knows that his goal is to never to commit sin and to be judged guilty by conservative Hebrews, and to be killed as a person who is cursed according to the law of Moses. 
30 And as soon as it happens, the law will become condemnable in the eyes of God who himself stated it by Moses.
31 And the law will cease to be valid so that God can again judge men by their faith in God, their faith in truth, their faith in the justice of heart, as was the case before the arrival of Moses (John 10:14-18 - 5 Rommel 5:33-34). 
32 Thus, all the righteous of all nations can receive the same spirit, the holy spirit, and are all equal before God as I have stated in the section 'Objective of the holy scriptures and the sacrifice of the man Jesus'. 
33 If anyone does not confess the only begotten Son of God, then he is charged with sins because he refuses the righteousness of the heart taught by God and he prefers either his own righteousness or the justice of certain men. 
34 And the righteousness of God is the resurrection of all those who died with Christ, because of the act of jurisprudence established by the man Jesus (John 16:7-11 - Malachi 3:6).
