1 About the Christ of God who lives forever.
2 Paul differentiates between the man Jesus and Christ the only begotten Son of God (Colossians 1:15). 
3 Christ is the first creation of God, but it is only at the birth of the man Jesus that he came into the world.
4 And he remained in the world after the departure of the man Jesus.
5 He remained in the world by sitting at the right of his father, and he is by definition the holy command given by the man Jesus.
6 The house of God announced by the prophet cannot be built by the hand of man (2 Samuel 7:5 - Isaiah 66:1-2). 
7 The house of God is built by Christ, and the house of God is the body of Christ. 
8 The body of Christ was born when the holy spirit was brought into the world after the departure of the man Jesus.
9 And to this day the body of Christ is that of a child, as I exposed to the section 'Falsifications in the Bible' (2 Samuel 7:12-16 - Daniel 7:14,27).
