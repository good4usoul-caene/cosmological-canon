1 How to offend or please the holy spirit (John 5:39-40 - Jeremiah 9:23-24), first part.
2 God’s love means that he will give a place, possibly anonymously (Galatians 6:7-8 - Ecclesiastes 9:13-15), to our heavenly body (Genesis 6:5-8 - 8:18-22). 
3 And this does not always translate into a long life (Luke 9:7-9 - 2 Chronicles 34:1-2 - 2 Samuel 5:4-5) but it is often the case (2 Peter 3:9,15). 
4 The substance of biblical narratives is to highlight different ways of being guilty or righteous towards the holy spirit and the message is the same: one does not overcome by force but by the spirit (2 Samuel 17:1-14 - 1 Samuel 2:9-10 - Isaiah 8:5-10,11-13). [Ben-hadad the king of Syria relied solely on his strength twice, and it was a failure (1 Kings 20:1-13,21-30). And then he had more success when he chose the way of the spirit (1 Kings 20:31-34). We can also notice that Nahash the Ammonite was a little arrogant in his behavior (1 Samuel 11:1-4,5-10,11-15).] 
5 The following concerns the notion of truth (John 18:38). 
6 Not all those who simulate transparency in their lives are Israel (2 Corinthians 11:14). There are remnants among Jacob and remnants among those who were never Jacob, and both form the Israel of God (Isaiah 44:1-6). 
7 A semantic theory of truth holds that truth is a property of sentences and if I affirm that truth is a relative notion, it is because there are two semantics which are not necessarily independent.
8 On the one hand there is the meaning of the words in a sentence, and on the other hand there is the meaning of a sentence in the particular context of a pair (sender - receiver). [The meaning of the same statement by Jesus may depend on the people to whom he gives this information (John 8:21-22 - 13:33-36), and a same sentence does not necessarily have the same meaning when it is said by two different persons since one can think that Abraham was not doubting unlike Sarah (Genesis 17:15-18 - 18:9-14 - Romans 4:19-22).]
9 There may therefore be situations where the truth of a statement can only be determined by the intentions of the author so that there may be several truths and several lies, each of the words truth and lie then referring not not to unique possibilities but to sets. 
10 Thus, to speak the truth only means to express oneself under the influence of the holy spirit, in other words to have in the heart good intentions in relation to arbitrarily chosen strangers in society. 
11 This is the context of the proposition P which states that truth is the light of human beings.
12 Light is the means by which we can achieve our goals with satisfaction, without this being followed by any unpleasant surprise through cause and effect relationships. 
13 It should be noted that everything a person does at any time is to achieve a specific goal which is sometimes only known to that person.
14 I am thirsty and I want to soothe this feeling. I want to eliminate a person to take advantage of certain circumstances in such and such a way. I hope to go to a paradise which perhaps does not exist.
15 Even Jesus of Nazareth is not God the holy spirit who is the holy one of Israel (John 12:44-45). Now Jesus of Nazareth speaks with parables (Luke 6:29 - 8:5-8,9-15 - 14:34-35 - 22:35-38 - John 6:35-36 - 10:6-7 - 12:32-36 - 13:10-11 - 16:25-29) because he interacts with people who trust in the law of Moses (Luke 6:6-11) in order to make them understand the exact definition of eternal life (John 11:21-27) and the only way to make a comfortable place in it (John 14:1-4,6-10), and those people should understand it by becoming fully aware of all the implications of the fact that he has risen from the dead (Luke 9:18-22,44-45 - John 20:8-9) and that the commandment concerning the sabbath day was given to them by Moses only so that Jesus may come to demonstrate the power of the holy spirit (4 Rommel 6:3 - 3 Rommel 2:12). And Jesus also speaks in parable with the aim of giving a special place in eternal life to the eleven disciples whom he has chosen (Luke 8:9-11 - 22:24-29), and they are eleven because it is necessary to exclude Judas who separated from the others when he left to perform the betrayal that allowed the Jewish leaders to arrest Jesus without putting themselves in danger (Luke 19:47-48 - 22:1-6,45-54 - John 11:55-57 - 12:9-13,17-19 - 18:1-13), and it is only after the Holy Spirit had come into the world that these eleven disciples truly understood all the words of Jesus (Acts 1:4-8 - 2:14-40) while a twelfth disciple understood the meaning of life and also the words of Jesus to which he had been exposed (Acts 1:12-26 - 2:1-4), and the apostle Paul also understood the meaning of life without having met Jesus in the flesh (Acts 9:1-27 - 22:1-21). The apostles have understood everything with regard to the implementation of faith, and the understanding of Peter was gradual and continued even after the day of Pentecost, and it seems to me to understanding of Paul was total from the time of his miraculous conversion (Acts 22:12-21), but none of them have understood everything with regard to the exact definition of eternal life and that is why they had strange discussions (Acts 15:1-32 - 17:1-7,8-14 - 28:17-24,25-29). [Now it is not normal for a person to express himself in parables if the necessity is not imposed by the context in which he finds himself (Luke 8:16 - 11:33). The apostle Paul intends to create a form of school to perpetuate the message of Jesus (4 Rommel 6:33-35 - 11:22) so that it may not be easily forgotten in all future generations who will certainly transgress in different ways as it has been since the beginning of the history of the chosen people (Judges 2:7-11 - John 2:23-25), and that is why he chooses to express himself in an indirect way (2 Corinthians 12:15-16 - 1 Timothy 2:5-8 - Colossians 4:2-4 - Ephesians 2:10). As for the apostles Peter and John in the two epistles of Peter and in the first epistle of John, they do not express themselves indirectly but they say what they know with their own words which come from the bottom of their heart according to the context in which they find themselves.]
16 And we see that David can seek a confirmation of an information that he already knows, as is the case with the angels of Yahweh (1 Samuel 17:20-30 - Zechariah 4:1-5,11-14). [Now concerning David he does not ask the same question to the same person, and concerning God he is God and he probes hearts (Genesis 4:9-10 - John 4:15-19).] 
17 The father of all creation (Jeremiah 10:11-16 - 1 Corinthians 8:5-6), and the light of the world (John 8:12 - 18:37), and the father of the children of Israel and of Jesus of Nazareth (Jeremiah 10:1-10 - 1 John 2:15-17). God the Father and God the Son and God the holy spirit.
