1 The mysteries raised and unexplained.
2 Reincarnation.
3 If we existed before the formation of the world (Job 38:1-4) then how coexist the physical world and that of the spirits (2 Kings 2:9-11 - 6:15-17 - Ezekiel 40:1-4 - Luke 9:28-34 - 2 Corinthians 12:2-4).
4 And can a spirit be born again into the world without being aware of it (Malachi 4:4-6 - Luke 1:13-17 - John 1:19-36).
5 Can a human spirit inhabit any other animal (Luke 8:26-35 - Genesis 9:5).
6 The children of angels.
7 How can a spirit procreate with a man’s daughter (Genesis 6:1-4 - Luke 1:35).
8 The second coming.
9 On the one hand we expect a final resurrection (Daniel 12:1-2 - John 5:28-29 - 6:40-47).
10 And on the other hand those who believe in him never die (John 11:25-27 - Luke 23:43). 
11 I think that from the moment when the only begotten Son of God sits at the right hand of his father, all those who die with the circumcised heart access directly to heaven by becoming sons of God, before the second coming which will concern the world as a whole, the rest of souls (1 Corinthians 15:51-53 - 1 Thessaloniciens 4:14-17).
