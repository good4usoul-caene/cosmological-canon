1 A psalm of David. Give me justice, O Yahweh, for I have walked in my innocence. I have trusted in Yahweh and that is why all my work will not be destroyed. 
2 Examine me, O Yahweh, probe me. Probe my kidneys and my heart.
3 For I have always remember your lovingkindness, and I have walked in your truth. 
4 I have not sat with those who love falseness, I have not joined the companies of dissemblers [those who engage in misleading behavior without having publicly acceptable justifications in their hearts]. 
5 I have hated the assembly of evildoers, and I have not sought to sit with the wicked. 
6 I will wash my hands in my innocence, O Yahweh, and walk around your altar. [And thus you will judge me without delay. For you cannot allow one with a guilty heart to use your holy place to deceive others into believing his innocence.] 
7 And there I will lift up my voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all your wondrous works. 
8 I love the dwelling place of your house, the place where your honor dwells. 
9 Do not gather my soul with those of the sinners, do not take away my life with those of men of blood. [Do not associate my final fate with those of people whose actions are unjustifiable. This is the wish of David, and it can be noted that Jesus the Son of God will be placed alone in a new tomb despite the fact of having been killed at the sides of two men among whom one was truly wicked.] 
10 Those men in whose hands is wickedness. Their right hand is full of bribes. 
11 As for me, I will walk in my innocence. Redeem me and be merciful to me. 
12 My foot stands on a high place. I will praise Yahweh in the assemblies.
