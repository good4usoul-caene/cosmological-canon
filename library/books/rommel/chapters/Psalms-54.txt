1 A psalm of David when the Ziphites came to Saul and said, Is not David hidden among us. Save me by your name, O God. Judge me by your power. 
2 Hear my prayer, O God. Listen to the words of my mouth. 
3 For strangers have risen up against me, and violent men seek my soul. They have not set God before them. Pause. 
4 And behold, God is my helper. The Lord is the strength of my soul.
5 He will requite the wickedness of my enemies. Punish them because of your faithfulness. 
6 As for me, I will offer you freewill offerings for sacrifices. I will praise your name, O Yahweh, because it is good. 
7 For he has saved me from all troubles, and my eye has seen the confusion of my enemies.
