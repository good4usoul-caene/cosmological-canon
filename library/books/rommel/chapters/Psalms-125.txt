1 Those who trust in Yahweh are like mount Zion. It cannot be removed, since it is established forever. 
2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so does Yahweh surround his people now and forever [no matter where they are]. 
3 For the scepter of wickedness will not stay very long on the portions of the righteous, lest the righteous stretch out their hands to wickedness. 
4 O Yahweh, you will do good to the righteous, to those who are upright in heart.
5 But Yahweh will punish those who go astray in their tortuous ways, and he will destroy the workers of iniquity. May peace be on Israel.
