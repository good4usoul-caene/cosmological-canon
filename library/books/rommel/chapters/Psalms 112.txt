1 Praise Yahweh. Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh, namely the man who finds his pleasure in the commandments of Yahweh. 
2 His posterity will be powerful on earth, for the legacies of the righteous persons are blessed. 
3 Wealth and treasures accompany his legacy, and his righteousness endures forever. 
4 A light shines in the darkness for each righteous person, for those who are merciful and compassionate and fair. 
5 A good man is merciful and lends, and he guides his businesses by equity. 
6 Surely he will never be moved, for the legacy of the righteous is forever. 
7 He will not be afraid of bad news, because his heart is steadfast in his confidence that Yahweh has a plan. 
8 His heart is strengthened, and he will not fear until he understands his triumph over his enemies. 
9 He is generous, he gives freely to the needy. His righteousness endures forever, and his horn will be exalted with honor. 
10 The wicked will see it and will grieve. He will gnash his teeth and consume his soul. The desire of the wicked will perish.
