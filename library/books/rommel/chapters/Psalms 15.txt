1 A psalm of David. O Yahweh, who will dwell in your tabernacle [in the heaven]. Who will rest on your holy mountain [in the heaven]. 
2 He who walks in integrity and acts with righteousness, and speaks the truth according to the certainties of his heart [he does not mislead anyone without having publicly acceptable justifications in his heart]. 
3 He does not slander with his tongue, nor does any evil to his neighbor, nor accepts a false report against his neighbor. [Evil is that which is intentional and unjustifiable in the eyes of any assembly of saints]
4 He does not admire contemptible behavior, and he honors the one whom he suspects of fearing Yahweh. He does not retract when he has sworn to his own disadvantage. 
5 He does not give his money to usury, nor take a gift against the innocent. He who does these things will never be moved.
