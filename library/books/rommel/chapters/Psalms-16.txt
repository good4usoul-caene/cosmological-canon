1 A psalm of David. Preserve me, O God, because I trust in you. 
2 O my soul, you have said to Yahweh: You are my Lord, I have no hope except you. 
3 Therefore all my delight is in the saints who are in the land, and in the godly persons. 
4 For the others multiply idols, they run after strange gods. But I will not participate in their offerings of blood [the offerings that glorify their wicked deeds]. I would have no respect for false gods. 
5 For Yahweh is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup. It is you who maintains my portion.
6 The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places. Yes, I have received a goodly portion. 
7 I will praise Yahweh my counselor. My heart teaches me even in the night. 
8 I always set Yahweh before me. I will not be moved because he is at my right hand. 
9 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices, and my flesh also will rest in hope. 
10 For you will not leave my soul in the grave. You will not allow your holy one to see corruption. 
11 You will make known to me the path of life. There is the fullness of joy in your presence, and everlasting pleasures at your right hand.
