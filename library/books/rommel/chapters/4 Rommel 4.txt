1 The Father and the Son and the holy spirit (John 1:17 - 10:30), first part: The Trinity.
2 Our intrinsic nature and the totality of information at our disposal determine our actions. Jonah did not know the exact definition of eternal life but just a vague idea of what it is (Job 14:10-15 - 1 Rommel 1:33), and he would prefer that God send someone else to make a fool of himself by announcing a real disaster that will never happen (Jonah 1:1-3 - 4:1-11). It is possible that the angels have already used him in this way a number of times, and it is for this reason that Jonah had fled, but we can think that Jonah is not perfect (Jonah 4:5-11 - 1 Rommel 3:20). 
3 And Jesus of Nazareth announces the following good news: We do not die, we simply change form (Zechariah 1:1-5,6 - Philippians 1:23-24 - Luke 20:34-38 - John 6:47-51 - 8:48-52 - 11:23-26 - 12:23-26,27-34 - 1 Corinthians 15:35-50 - 2 Timothy 1:9-10 - 1 Peter 3:18).
4 We become exactly the information that we have created in the world (John 6:51-60,61-63 - Acts 25:19 - 1 John 3:6 - 4 Rommel 1:20 - 1 Corinthians 6:13-14 - 2 Corinthians 4:10-12 - Galatians 4:19 - 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20 - 3:1-8) and whose evolution depends solely on natural phenomena and those who are physically alive, in other words on God the Father. [Even in experimental physical sciences (4 Rommel 1:8-12 - Colossians 2:1-3,4-9), any object that exists in the physical world does only one of the following two things, or both at the same time: (a) It transforms itself into another object by undergoing modifications of any kind. (b) It contributes in one way or another to the changes of states of the other objects of the physical world.] 
5 God the Father is the abstract concept of truth. Everything that happens in nature is his work (Proverbs 16:1,9,33 - 19:21 - 20:24 - Amos 3:6 - Jeremiah 10:23 - Job 23:13-17 - Ephesians 2:10). 
6 And it is his angels, heavenly bodies, who speak to men in visions or dreams (Genesis 22:11-16 - 31:11-13 - Exodus 3:2-6 - 24:9-12 - 33:18-20 - Hosea 12:3-5 - Daniel 9:21-22 - 10:12-13,20-21 - Luke 1:18-20,26-31 - John 1:18 - Acts 12:5-11). For there are visions (Ezekiel 1:1-28 - 3:22-24), and there are dreams (Jeremiah 31:23-26), and sometimes the prophet can just hear a voice in his head (1 Samuel 9:14-19 - Acts 10:17-22). 
7 When we are unjust, it always allows God to accomplish purposes but our guilt remains because of the purpose of life (Romans 3:5-8 - 1 Kings 14:1-16 - 16:1-7,8-20 - Ezekiel 3:16-21 - 33:1-9,20 - Acts 20:24-27 - Luke 22:21-22 - Jeremiah 9:23-24).
8 The prophets of God were those who had conversations with the angels of the holy spirit (2 Kings 9:7 - Ezekiel 14:1-11 - 20:7 - 33:30-33 - Acts 20:17-23 - 27:21-26 - 3 Rommel 1:20-21). It is the consistency of the good quality of the concerns of a person that makes him a potential prophet in the eyes of the angels of the holy spirit (Ecclesiastes 5:1-3,4-7 - Philippians 4:8 - Jeremiah 31:23-26 - Daniel 9:21-23 - 1 Corinthians 11:20-28,29-34), and it is only a question of why he thinks what he thinks and not what he thinks about. 
9 God the holy spirit is the intimate conviction of being well-intentioned, not in relation to a particular person or community but in relation to arbitrarily chosen strangers in society. 
10 God the Father only strengthens the works of God the holy spirit eventually over long periods of time (Psalms 119:152,160 - Ecclesiastes 3:14 - Jeremiah 9:1-9 - 22:1-5,13-18 - Philippians 2:8-11 - Jeremiah 18:1-10,11-13) and it is in this sense that these two Gods are one and indifferently called by the same name in the holy scriptures.  
11 Obeying the statutes and the commandments and the ordinances of God (Genesis 26:5 - Ezekiel 5:5-8,9-11) means obeying God the holy spirit by conforming to the customs going on in the surrounding society (Genesis 14:17-20 - Ezra 5 - Romans 13:1-7 - 1 Peter 2:13-17 - Luke 20:20-26) without ever submitting to any form of idolatry (1 Samuel 14:24-30,37-45). 
12 Consequently, invoking the name of God (Genesis 4:26 - 12:6-9 - 13:1-4 - 21:33-34 - 26:24-25 - Exodus 6:1-3) means claiming or celebrating justice and fairness (2 Samuel 6:12-15 - 1 Kings 8:9 - Proverbs 21:3 - 30:2-9).
13 God the Son, also called Christ, is the abstract concept of love of general interest and Jesus of Nazareth was its first incarnation (Luke 1:35 - John 15:9-12). 
14 God the Son is the only intermediary between God the holy spirit and the world (Acts 25:19 - John 14:15-19 - 10:7-16) and it is in this sense that these two Gods are one and indifferently called by the same name in the holy scriptures.
15 In a same sentence of a biblical text, each occurrence of a reference to God actually designates only one of these three Gods and not necessarily the same for the different occurrences (3 Rommel 1:10). 
16 For example, since by definition everyone is in God the Father, the expression 'I am in the father' (John 14:10) can only have a particular meaning if this is translated by 'I remain in the love of the father' and since it is only the works of God the holy spirit that are loved by God the Father, the word father actually designates God the holy spirit who moreover is actually the real father of Jesus of Nazareth according to the flesh (Luke 1:34-35).
17 God the Father (Deuteronomy 32:39 - Psalms 139:1-16 - Isaiah 66:1-2), and God the Son (Genesis 49:10 - 1 Chronicles 17:11-14 - Zechariah 2:10-11 - 12:10), and God the holy spirit (Numbers 11:24-29 - 2 Samuel 23:1-4 - 1 Kings 19:1-13).
