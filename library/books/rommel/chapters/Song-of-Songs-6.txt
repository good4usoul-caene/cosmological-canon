1 Where has your beloved gone, O you the most beautiful among women. Which way has your beloved turned. Tell it so that we may seek him with you. 
2 My beloved [who is my bridegroom] has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, in order to feed his flock in the gardens and to gather lilies. 
3 I belong to my beloved, and my beloved is mine. He feeds his flock among the lilies. 
4 O my love [my bride], you are beautiful as Tirzah and pleasant as Jerusalem. And you are terrible like an army with banners. 
5 Turn your eyes away from me, for they overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats that graze on the slopes of Gilead.
6 Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes coming up from the washing. None of them is barren, and each of them bears twins.
7 Your cheeks are like two pieces of a pomegranate behind your veil.  
8 There may be sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number. 
9 But none of them is like my dove, my undefiled (who have been purified). She is the only daughter of her mother, and she is loved by her who gave birth to her. The virgins see her and blessed her, and the queens and concubines also praise her. 
10 Who is she who shines like the dawn. She is beautiful as the moon, and pure as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners. 
11 I went down to the garden of walnut trees in order to see the fruit of the valley, to see if the vine had budded and if the pomegranates had flourished.
12 And before I was aware, my soul set me on the chariots of my noble people. 
13 Return, return, O Shulamite. Return, return, so that we may contemplate you. Why do you contemplate the Shulamite as one contemplates the dance of Mahanaim.
