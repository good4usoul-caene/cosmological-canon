1 A psalm of the sons of Korah. Yahweh is great. He is greatly praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
2 Beautiful is the hill, the joy of the whole earth. It is mount Zion, and its north side is the city of the great King.
3 In the palaces of the city, God is known to be the refuge. 
4 For lo, the kings had assembled and intended to fight against this city. 
5 But they came and saw it, and they were astonished. They were afraid and they fled. 
6 They were seized by a trembling there, as the pain of a woman in labor. 
7 They were driven away as by an east wind with which you break the ships of Tarshish. 
8 As we had heard [the reports of your past deeds], so we have seen in the city of Yahweh the God of armies, the city of our God. 
9 We remember your goodness, O God, in the midst of your temple. 
10 According to your name, O God, your praise will reach to the ends of the earth. For your right hand is full of righteousness. 
11 Let mount Zion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad, because of the fairness of your judgments. 
12 Walk through Zion, go around its borders and count its towers. 
13 Observe its wall and consider its palaces, in order to tell it to the next generation [because it may no longer look the same in the future].
14 For this God is our God forever and ever. He will be our guide even to death.
