1 Come, and let us rejoice in Yahweh. Let us sing joyfully to the rock of our salvation. 
2 Let us come before him with praise, let us sing to him with a song of joy. 
3 For Yahweh is a great God. He is a great king above all gods.
4 In his hand are the depths of the earth, and the tops of the mountains are his. 
5 The sea is his, for he made it. And his hands formed the dry land. 
6 Come, and we will worship and bow down. Let us kneel before Yahweh our Maker. 
7 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture. We are his sheep and are under his hand. 
8 If you hear his voice today [that is to say, if his existence and his way of acting are taught to you], then do not harden your hearts as at Massah, and as in the day of Meribah in the wilderness. 
9 Where your fathers tested me, and probed me, although they had seen my work. 
10 Therefore I had hated that generation for forty years, and had said: This is a people whose heart has erred. They do not know my ways. 
11 Therefore I had sworn in my wrath by saying: They will not enter into my rest.
