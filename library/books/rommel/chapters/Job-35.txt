1 And Elihu continued in the following words. 
2 Do you think that you are right to say, I am more righteous than God. 
3 For you have said: What is the benefit to God when he pursues me for the sins of my youth, and what would I gain by not pleading my cause against God. 
4 Therefore I will answer you, and your companions with you. 
5 Look to the sky, and see and contemplate the clouds which are above you. 
6 If you sin then what harm do you cause him. And when your sins multiply, what do you do to him. 
7 If you are righteous then what do you give him or what does he receive from your hand. 
8 Your wickedness can only harm a man like you, and your righteousness is useful only to the son of man. 
9 It is because of the multitude of oppressions that they cry out. They complain about the violence of the mighty. 
10 But none of them said: Where is God who created me, and who inspired songs of joy in the night. 
11 The one who teaches us more than [what we learn from] the beasts of the earth, and gives us more wisdom than [what we acquire from] the birds of the sky. 
12 Therefore God does not answer when they cry out because of the violence of the wicked.
13 Certainly God does not listen to futilities. The Almighty does not pay attention to it. 
14 As for you, you say to God: You do not consider me. But your case is before him, so wait for him. 
15 But now that you say he punishes the guilty and the innocent alike, do you think he does not pay attention to arrogance. 
16 Thus Job opens his mouth in vain and multiplies words without knowledge.
