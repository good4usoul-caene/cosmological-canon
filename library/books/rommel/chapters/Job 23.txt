1 And Job spoke in the following words. 
2 Despite the fact that my speeches of these days are in bitterness, and the fact that my scourge is greater than my groans.
3 If God would let me know how to find him, then I would go into his place. 
4 And I would plead my cause before him, and I would fill my mouth with arguments. 
5 I would know the words with which he would respond to me and I would understand what he would say to me. 
6 Would he use all his strength to fight me. Would he not at least listen to me. 
7 At the place of his habitation, it is the upright who would reason with me. Therefore, I should be forever absolved by my judge. 
8 But behold, if I go now to the east then he is not there. And if I go to the west then I will not perceive him. 
9 Even if he is busy in the north then I will not be able to find him. Or maybe he is hiding somewhere in the south so that I cannot behold him. 
10 However he knows how I walk. And if he tests me then I will come out as pure as gold. 
11 For my foot has followed his steps: I have followed his way and I have not departed from it.
12 Neither have I departed from the commandment of his lips. And I valued the words of his mouth more than the food that was intended for me. 
13 But his resolution is fixed, and who can oppose him. He executes what his mind desires. 
14 For he will do what is appointed for me. And there are many similar things with him. 
15 That is why his presence terrifies me. When I think about it, I am afraid of him. 
16 For God has softened my heart, the Almighty has filled me with fear. 
17 For I am not shut up in darkness, but he has hidden the darkness from my face.
