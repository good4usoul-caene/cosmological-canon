1 Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke in the following words. 
2 When will you put an end to your words. Instruct us and then we will speak. 
3 Why are we considered beasts, and are we vile in your sight.
4 You are like one who tears his soul in his anger. Will the earth be abandoned because of you. Or the rock removed from its place. 
5 The light of the wicked will be extinguished and the flame that springs from it will cease to shine. 
6 The light will darken in his dwelling, and his candle will be extinguished with him. 
7 The steps of his strength will be restrained, and his own counsel will cause him to fall. 
8 For he is caught in the nets by his feet, and he walks on the traps. 
9 He is caught in the snare by the heel, and the thief will come on him. 
10 A snare is set for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
11 Terrors will frighten him on all sides and pursue him. 
12 Hunger will consume his strength, and destruction will be ready at his side. 
13 It will devour the inner parts of his skin, and the firstborn of death will devour his strength. 
14 His hope will be taken away from his house and this will cause him to go to the king of fear. 
15 None of his own will remain in his tent, and brimstone will be scattered on his habitation. 
16 His roots will be dried up below, and his branch above will be cut off.
17 His remembrance will disappear from the earth, and he will no longer have a name in the street. 
18 They will drive him from the light to the darkness, and throw him out of the world. 
19 He will have neither son nor nephew among his people, nor any posterity to perpetuate his heritage. 
20 Future generations will be astonished at his ruin, and fear will come on the elders. 
21 No other destiny for the wicked, no other fate for those who do not know God.
