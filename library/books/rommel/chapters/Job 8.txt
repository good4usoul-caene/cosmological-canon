1 Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke in the following words. 
2 How long do you want to talk like that. And how long will the words of your mouth be like a mighty wind. 
3 Does God pervert judgment, does the Almighty subvert justice. 
4 If your sons have sinned against him, then he delivered them to their iniquity. 
5 But you, if you turn to God and implore the Almighty. 
6 If you are pure and upright, then he will surely watch over you and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous. 
7 And though your beginning be small, your latter end will greatly increase. 
8 Question those of past generations, pay attention to the experience of their fathers. 
9 Because we are from yesterday and we know nothing. Our days on earth are but a shadow. 
10 Will not they teach you and tell you, and speak words out of their hearts. 
11 Does the rush grow without marshes. Does the reed grow without water. 
12 Even if it were green and uncut, it will wither before any other herb. 
13 Thus are the ways of all those who forget God, and the hope of the wicked will perish. 
14 His confidence is broken, and his trust will be like a spider's web. 
15 He leans on his house, but it will not stand. He clings to it, but it will not endure. 
16 He is like a green tree before the sun, and its branches extend over its garden. 
17 It intertwines its roots among the stones, it penetrates even into the walls. 
18 But when it is removed from the place it occupies, then this place will deny it and say, I never knew you. 
19 Behold this is the joy of his way, and others will arise from the land. 
20 God does not reject the righteous man and he does not protect the wicked. 
21 He will fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with joy. 
22 Your enemies will be clothed with shame, and the dwelling place of the wicked will disappear.
