1 Praise Yahweh. Praise Yahweh, O my soul. 
2 I will praise Yahweh as long as I live. I will sing praises to my God as long as I have any being. 
3 Do not trust in princes [leaders], nor in the children of men, for they cannot save. 
4 When their breath departs, they return to the dust and their thoughts perish on the same day. 
5 Blessed is the one whose help is the God of Jacob, namely the one whose hope is in Yahweh his God. 
6 He made the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and all that is in them. He keeps his mercy forever. 
7 He executes justice for the oppressed, he gives food to the hungry. Yahweh frees the captives. 
8 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind. Yahweh lifts up those who are bowed down. Yahweh loves the righteous. 
9 Yahweh loves those who care about the strangers, and who sustain the fatherless and the widow. And Yahweh turns the way of the wicked upside down to destroy them. 
10 Yahweh reigns forever. O Zion, your God perdures from generation to generation. Praise Yahweh.
