1 A psalm of David, when the Philistines received him to make him dwell in Gath [when he was fleeing from the presence of Saul]. Have mercy on me, O God. For man want to swallow me up. He continually fights against me and torments me. 
2 My enemies want to swallow me up every day. For many are those who fight against me, O Most High. 
3 When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
4 I will rejoice in God, because of his word. I have put my trust in God, therefore I will not fear what a living being made of flesh can do to me.
5 They always change the meaning of my words. When their thoughts turn towards me, it is only to harm me.
6 They plot, they spy, they watch my steps, because they want to kill me. 
7 It is through their iniquity that they hope to triumph. Bring these people down in your anger, O God. 
8 You count the steps of my wanderings. Collect my tears in your bottle. Are they not inscribed in your book. 
9 My enemies will turn back when I cry to you, I know that it will be so. For God is with me [since I fear him].
10 I will rejoice in God, because of his word. I will rejoice in Yahweh because of his word. 
11 I have put my trust in God, therefore I will not fear what man can do to me. 
12 I will fulfill the vows that I have made to you, O God. I will praise you continuously. 
13 For you have saved my soul from death. You have prevented my feet from falling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
