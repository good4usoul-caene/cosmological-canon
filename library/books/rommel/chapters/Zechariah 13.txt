1 In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness. 
2 In that day, says Yahweh the God of armies, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land and they will no longer be remembered. And I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirits to depart from the land. 
3 And if anyone prophesies again, then his father and his mother who begot him will say to him, 'You will not live, because you speak lies in the name of Yahweh'. And his father and his mother who begot him will stab him when he prophesies. 
4 In that day the prophets will be ashamed every one of his visions when he prophesies, and they will no longer wear a eye-catching garment to deceive. 
5 And every one of them will say: I am not a prophet, I am a plowman. For I was bought from my youth. 
6 And if anyone asks him, 'Where did these wounds on your hands come from'. Then he will say, 'I received them in the house of my friends'. 
7 Arise, O sword, against my shepherd and against the man who is my companion, says Yahweh the God of armies. Smite the shepherd, and let the sheep be scattered, and I will turn my hand on the powerless. 
8 And throughout all the land, says Yahweh, two thirds will be cut off and will die, and the other third will remain. 
9 And I bring that third part into the fire, and I will refine them as silver is refined, and I will test them as gold is tested. An they will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, 'It is my people', and they will say, 'Yahweh is my God'.
