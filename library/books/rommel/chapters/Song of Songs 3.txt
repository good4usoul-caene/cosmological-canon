1 On my bed during the night, I sought him whom my soul loves. I sought him [who is my bridegroom], but I did not find him. 
2 And I said: I will arise now and go around the city, in the streets and in the squares. I will seek him whom my soul loves. 
3 I sought him, but I did not find him. The watchmen who go around the city found me, and I said to them: Have you seen him whom my soul loves. 
4 I had just left the watchmen when I found him whom my soul loves. I took hold of him [who is my bridegroom], and did not want to let him go until I had brought him to my mother's house, into the private room of her who conceived me.

7 Here is Solomon's chariot, and around it there are sixty valiant men of the valiant of Israel. 
8 All of them are armed with the sword, and they are expert in war. Each one has his sword on his waist, to defend against the terrors of the night. 
9 King Solomon made for himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon. 
10 He overlaid its pillars with silver, and its inside with gold. The seat was made of purple, and inlaid in its midst with the love by the daughters of Jerusalem. 
11 Come out, O daughters of Zion, and look at king Solomon and the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his marriage, on the day of the gladness of his heart.
