1 A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, you have been our refuge from generation to generation. 
2 Before the mountains were made, and before you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. 
3 You cause man to become dust again, for you say: Return, you the children of man. 
4 For a thousand years in your sight are as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. 
5 You carry them away like a dream which ends in the morning. 
6 We are like grass. In the morning [namely at the beginning] it blossoms and grows, but in the evening [namely at the end] it is cut down and withers. 
7 We are consumed by your anger, and your fury terrifies us. 
8 You have set our iniquities before you. You bring our hidden sins in the light of your countenance. 
9 All [the work that we have done during] our days can be devoured by your anger. We see our years vanish like a sigh. 
10 The duration of our days is almost seventy years, or almost eighty years for those who are more resilient. And the pride that we can get is full of labor and sorrow. And it quickly disappears, because we fly away.
11 Who knows the power of your anger. For the fear that is due to you should be as intense as your fury. 
12 Teach us to count our days, so that we may be aware of their insignificance, and so that we may understand the necessity of making wisdom dwell in our hearts. 
13 Return, O Yahweh. How much longer. Have mercy on your servants. 
14 Satisfy us every morning with your lovingkindness, so that we may rejoice and be glad for the rest of our days. 
15 Comfort us as many days as you have afflicted us, as many years as we have seen misfortunes. 
16 Let your work be revealed to your servants, and your glory to their children. 
17 May the favor of the Lord our God be on us. Establish the work of our hands. Yes, establish the work of our hands.
