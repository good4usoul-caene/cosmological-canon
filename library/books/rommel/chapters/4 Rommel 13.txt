1 Moses (Numbers 28–29) vs Ezekiel (Ezekiel 45–46) concerning the obligatory part of burnt offerings, and burnt offerings are not eaten (4 Rommel 7:13). And these are the only offerings for which there are fixed dates in advance. [The only other offerings that are obligatory according to the law of Moses and that Ezekiel did not mention are the offering that must be made on the day of reconciliation (1 Rommel 3:35), and on the occasion of the celebration of the harvests at the feast of Firstfruits (Leviticus 23:9-22).] 
2 Regarding the perpetual holocaust, on the one hand the meal offering is a tenth of an ephah of fine flour kneaded in a quarter of a hin of crushed olive oil every morning and every evening (Numbers 28:1-8). 
3 And on the other hand the meal offering is one-sixth of an ephah and one-third of a hin of oil every morning Ezekiel (46:13-15). 
4 Each sabbath day, on the one hand, two yearling lambs are to be offered with a meal offering of two-tenths of an ephah (Numbers 28:9-10).
5 And on the other hand, six lambs and a ram are to be offered with a ephah for the ram and a voluntary gift for each lamb (Ezekiel 46:4-5).
6 At the beginning of each month which is the new moon, on the one hand it takes two bullocks and a ram and seven lambs (Numbers 28:11-15).
7 And on the other hand it takes a bullock and a ram and six lambs (Ezekiel 46:6-7,11).
8 During each of the seven consecutive days of the feast which follows the fourteenth day of the first month, on the one hand there must be two bullocks and a ram and seven lambs (Numbers 28:16-25).
9 And on the other hand there must be seven bullocks and seven rams (Ezekiel 45:21-24). 
10 And during each of the seven consecutive days of the feast which begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the sacrifices must be identical for each each day according to Ezekiel (Ezekiel 45:21-24,25).
11 While there is from day by day a constant reduction of the number of bullocks to be offered according to Moses (Numbers 29:12-40). 
12 We also notice a difference on the associated meal offerings (Numbers 29:14-15 - Ezekiel 46:11).
13 On the one hand, Moses had specified the ceremony that must be performed for the consecration of Aaron, and also each time for the consecration of the one among his sons who is chosen to succeed him as high priest (Exodus 29:1-14,29-34,35-37). And when Moses had set up the sanctuary of Yahweh for the first time after its construction, twelve leaders had approached to make an offering for the dedication of the sanctuary. There was one leader from each of the twelve tribes who are not supposed to serve in the sanctuary, since Levi is not included and Joseph is divided into two tribes. And those leaders had made a common offering which was to have some use for the sons of Levi whom Yahweh had chosen to be at his service in the sanctuary and to move this sanctuary each time when the congregation had to be moved (Numbers 7:1-9), and those leaders had also presented offerings for the inauguration of the altar of sacrifices (Numbers 7:10-11,84-88), but these offerings were made voluntarily and not according to a law imposed by Yahweh since different offerings were made for the dedication of the temple built by Solomon (1 Kings 8:62-63 - 2 Chronicles 7:1-5) and for the dedication of the temple that had just been rebuilt after the return of the captives from Babylon (Ezra 6:15-18). We notice that Yahweh loves very much the deeds that are done voluntarily by the initiative of the heart and not because of an external constraint (Leviticus 7:11-16,17-18 - 19:5-6 - 22:29-30 - Ezekiel 43:4 - 46:12 - Malachi 1:14 - 2 Chronicles 30:21-27), but he who does such a deed must be careful not to transgress the law of which he is aware (2 Rommel 5 - Romans 2:28-29). 
14 On the other hand, in the temple of Ezekiel the priests will be only the sons of Zadok who is himself a descendant of Aaron (Ezekiel 44:10-14,15-16), and Ezekiel says nothing about the consecration of the sons of Zadok but he describes the ritual that must be performed only once during seven days for the inauguration of the altar of sacrifices (Ezekiel 43:18-21,22-27).
