1 At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan and king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah. For he had heard how Hezekiah had been sick and had recovered.
2 And Hezekiah was very pleased with their initiative, and showed them all the valuable things that he owned. He showed them the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house and in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them. 
3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah and said to him, What have these men said and from where have they come to you. And Hezekiah answered, They have come from a far country, from Babylon. 
4 Then Isaiah said, What have they seen in your house. And Hezekiah answered: They have seen all that is in my house, and there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them. 
5 And Isaiah said to Hezekiah: Hear the word of Yahweh the God of armies.
6 Behold the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left, Yahweh has spoken it.
7 And of your sons who will proceed from you, namely those whom you will beget, they will be taken away and will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of Yahweh that you have spoken is good. And Hezekiah said: For there will be safety and tranquility during the days that I have yet to live. [Let each generation take care of its own problems. Now Hezekiah is not perfect as it is the case of any normal human being, because he is not Christ.]
