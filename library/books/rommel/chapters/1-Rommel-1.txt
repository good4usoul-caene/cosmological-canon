1 General preface, first part.
2 Translation being known to be a difficult art, and the sources of biblical texts being multiple, and because it is necessary to understand that the holy character of the Bible is in the meaning of the statements (Deuteronomy 18:18-19 - Acts 3:22-23). 
3 This work offers a coherent version of the holy scriptures resulting from an analysis of three translations belonging to the public domain namely The American Standard Version of the Holy Bible (1901), and The Bible and Holy Scriptvres Conteined in the Olde and Newe Teftament (The Geneva Bible 1560), and La Bible Louis Segond 1910. [I sometimes consulted other versions to be able to express simply some difficult verses, especially 'The Holy Bible: Easy-to-Read Version' and to a lesser extent 'The Complete Jewish Bible', but these occurrences are extremely rare since this has happened almost thirty times.] 
4 The complexity of modern languages does not seem to me adapted to the development of the mind. 
5 And because meditation on the scriptures expands the mind, it must be considered for a greater clarity that a biblical verse is always a combination of at most three basic types of sentences. 
6 These are the informative sentences where the sender only wants to transmit information to the receiver (Deuteronomy 6:4). 
7 And the interrogative sentences where the sender only wants to receive information from the receiver (John 13:25 - John 14:8).
8 And meditative sentences where the sender only wants to stimulate the imagination of the receiver (2 Samuel 7:2 - 1 Chronicles 17:1). 
9 The Devil's ruse does not only consist of democratizing bad conscience, but also of promoting behaviors and tools that are either useless or destructive.
10 Such as the evolution of the meaning of words preserved by the continual updating of language standards. They look innocent and happy while committing their crimes and also the spelling of words is gradually changed in friendly conversations, 'you' becomes 'ya' or 'than' becomes 'then' or 'its' becomes 'it's'. This is completely satanic since we can enrich a vocabulary without modifying the meaning of existing words, and the synonyms can then be freely multiplied in order to nuance the possible contexts (Romans 12:1-2).
11 I do not feel better than them but we must glorify God and tell the truth (John 9:24): Real actors who look like normal people but it is only an appearance, because their souls are possessed by a multitude of demons under the direction of jealousy (Numbers 11:24-29). They excel by creativity in deception and wickedness, and the games of appearances. Deep within their inner being, they are deprived of the joy and plenitude of God which also manifested itself in sadness (1 Timothy 2:1-4 - Luke 6:20-38). 
12 They have an unusual potential for nuisance, because they appropriate a truth that they do not understand and use it to manipulate fragile souls. In these conditions where the objective is to pervert a message that is however worthy of being received, it is not difficult to imagine the extent of their malefic power that feeds on the simplicity of honest people. 
13 Perhaps it is also about filling a frustration and experiencing a feeling of belonging while dignity lies elsewhere (John 4:22). For they are so blind that they glory in what defiles their soul (Deuteronomy 14:21). And the fact of conceiving of any small action to denigrate certain particular communities [flesh and blood] and not only evil spirits, this also does not advance a rapprochement with the holy spirit who is the true God.
14 When I try to just think about the meaning of all these things, it makes me sick. But make no mistake, I am not the enemy of the Jews but I am the friend of the human kind (2 Corinthians 7:8-12). I have harsh words but what must disappear for the glorification of God is the dirt of their mentality and not human beings. 
15 For this way of thinking constitutes the dirtiest thing in the eyes of the holy one (Luke 11:38-42) therefore those among them who do not act out of ignorance are simply human waste [they are the most deviant of the sorcerer kinds, now I know exactly what they are]. Professionals of injustice deguised into angels of light, they are a cursed kind. But God the Father loves everyone and reserves for each a particular purpose in eternity. 
16 There is no doubt in my mind that judaism as a religious practice must be completely eradicated for the flourishing of humanity (Romans 10:4), it is impossible for it to be otherwise. For judaism is one of the last shames of the human kind, the most sneaky antichrist (1 John 2:18-20), since in reality every human being is jewish. For if exactly no one is jewish anymore in the sense that the tribes of Jacob have disappeared, it is equivalent to say that everyone is jewish since the Hebrew Bible is not destined to disappear but rather to directly or indirectly instruct all the children of God.
17 But they are not all guilty because there are also ignorant among them, since everyone is born in ignorance. The culprit is the one who rejects the truth after having really understood its meaning, this one is like a well-dressed dog (Philippians 3:1-3). They are usurpers of titles.
18 And the ignorant does not understand that the power of God is to be truly obsessed with the well-being of all in a global way without any specific discrimination, not even towards one's enemies. For when you design traps to make others fall and thus better position yourself, you offend in this way the holy spirit who then moves away from you and takes revenge for eternity at a favorable moment. But we are not invited to maintain relationships of complacency since evil friendship corrupt good morals (1 Corinthians 15:32-34).
19 For the only thing that God asks is to be constantly convinced to act for the well-being of all humanity by relying on as much reliable information as possible, either to condemn a person to death or to save this person. And the spirit does not take pleasure in the games of appearances and it rejoices only in what is just and worthy. And God uses some to punish others but he constantly observes each person in a completely individual way (Job 34 - 2 Chronicles 16:9 - 28:8-11 - Habakkuk 1:6-12 - Proverbs 24:17-18 - Jeremiah 9:23-24 - 3 Rommel 1:25 - 4 Rommel 4:7).
20 For the writings of the Hebrew Bible broaden the mind and deepen the exact knowledge of God (Leviticus 26:39-46 - Deuteronomy 15:1-11 - 29:29 - 31:9-13). However, concerning their genealogical or periodic particularities or any other characteristic ritual of community belonging, this could have remained even during the period of the exile of the genealogical family of Jacob in Babylon and elsewhere before the construction of the second temple of God by the initiative of king Cyrus (Jeremiah 30:1-11 - Ezra 1:1-3), but all had been completely and totally removed by the coming of Jesus Christ the Son of God (John 1:17-18 - 12:44-50 - 17:17 - Luke 20:21).
21 For the law given by Moses has lost its flavor by the coming of the perfect knowledge of God (Luke 14:34-35). It is no longer useful to identify the paternal tribes and their distinct inheritances in the promised land, and the commandments of Moses must be used only to make the truth understood (Romans 3:19-22 - Galatians 3:19-22). 
22 Regardless of syntax, variations in semantics that concern some verses of different translations of the Bible can cause the adoption of a bad pedagogy. 
23 As examples, we cannot confuse the word protest synonymous of dispute, with the word attestation and its synonyms (Galatians 5:3). 
24 Or the word indignation synonymous of disgust and repugnance, with the word anger possibly transformed into the word annoyance (2 Kings 3:27). 
25 Or the expression 'violation of promise' with the expression 'deprivation of presence' or the word alienation (Numbers 14:34).
26 Furthermore, several modern translations of the Bible do not claim a formal equivalence and multiply inappropriate additional information in different verses. 
27 And concerning part of certain books of the Bible, the numbering of verses and even chapters varies either according to categories of translations or according to different revisions of a same translation. This does not seem completely innocent to me. 
28 And if the list of books of scripture which preceded the Son of God varies according to the biblical translations, the universality of the list of books constituting the testament of Jesus Christ, his legacy bequeathed to the world, is not without arousing suspicion. 
29 The gospels of Matthew and Mark each highlight a contrasting personality of Jesus and contain details designed to prevent understanding of the message that can be extracted from the other two versions of the gospel. 
30 For the falsifiers are content to use extracts from the thought of holy men, ordinary men during their holiness, to make poetry as in the introduction of the book of Revelation of John where the following words are written. 
31 John to the seven churches that are in Asia. May grace and peace be with you, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come. And from the seven spirits who are before his throne. And from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness, and the firstborn of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. The one who loved us and delivered us from our sins by his blood. The one who made us a kingdom of priests to God his Father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Behold he comes with the clouds. And every eye will see him, and those who pierced him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of him. Yes. Amen. I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord. The one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty (Revelation 1:4-8). 
32 There is only one Church which is the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 1:1-18 - Ephesians 1:15-23), there are neither two nor seven.
33 This reminds us of the three friends of Job who did not let themselves be inspired only by circumstances in order to avoid condemning Job for a fault that they could not identify, but also multiplied beautiful words which however have a meaning (Job 12:1-3 - 13:1-10 - 16:1-6 - 32:1-5 - 42:7) even if it is only a partial meaning because the exact definition of eternal life is unknown to these people (Job 19:25-27 - 21:23-26 - 23:1-9 - 24:20 - 2 Chronicles 6:18 - Ecclesiastes 3:16-22 - 5:15-17). They just have a vague idea of what it is (Deuteronomy 25:17-19 - Joshua 7:9 - Psalms 15 - 21 - 24 - 73 - Proverbs 12:7).
34 The only message of the Bible is that it was Jesus Christ who clearly revealed the existence and exact knowledge of the concept of eternal life to all those who could still doubt it (3 Rommel 1:28-29 - 4 Rommel 6:4-7 - 12:5-9). And he also revealed the right way to find an admirable place in eternal life (Zechariah 4:6 - John 13:34-35 - 21:15-17 - 1 John 2:24-26,27-29 - 3 Rommel 1:30 - 4 Rommel 6:8 - 12:50-56). 
35 And concerning the persons who were subject to the complex laws given by Moses, some of the actions that were not sins before Jesus of Nazareth became sins after Jesus of Nazareth  (Nehemiah 13 - Esther 3:1-6 - John 8:21-26 - Galatians 5:1), and some of the actions that were sins before Jesus of Nazareth [and after the reception of Moses' law] were no longer sins after Jesus of Nazareth (2 Chronicles 16 - 2 Kings 1:1-15). This is how some conversations between biblical characters were very serious in their context and yet seem comical today (1 Samuel 26). 
36 And when the world had not yet received the exact knowledge of the identity of God and of the notion of the holy spirit (4 Rommel 6:9 - John 6:27-33 - 7:37-39 - 16:7-11 - Acts 1:1-8), that is to say the exact understanding of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth [because there are partial understandings (Luke 24:13-27,45-49 - John 2:13-22 - 20:8-9,21-23 - Acts 1:6-8)], the sins of any person who felt himself subject to the laws given by Moses could occur at any time during his life as it also has been the case for Solomon (1 Kings 11:1-13). But after the world had received the exact understanding of the concept of the holy spirit (3 Rommel 1:7-12,16-19), the necessary transgressions of an ordinary person (1 Rommel 3:20) can no longer occur after the time when knowledge is received by this person (4 Rommel 12:14-15 - 5 Rommel 12:19-24). 
37 The notion of holy spirit does not change over time because it is the relationship between what a person actually knows and what this person hopes, in other words it is why you do what you do and not what you do (2 Corinthians 5:7). But the information increases in the world over time since each living being creates a certain information (Exodus 30:12-16 - Leviticus 25:23-34 - Numbers 27:1-11 - Judges 11:40 - 4 Rommel 4:3-4), and therefore there has been a improvement in knowledge of the Holy Spirit over time as it can be seen by reading the beginning of the gospel of Luke where the Holy Spirit is present (Luke 1:8-15,41-42,67-75 - 3 Rommel 1:16) and the beginning of the book of Acts where the Holy Spirit is awaited (Acts 1:1-3,4-8). When a person has the will not to voluntarily harm others without justification, and to constantly seek to understand the concept of good and the well-being of others, then the holy spirit rewards that person by allowing him to create in the world of living an information that will influence the transformation of the world (Genesis 17:1-13,23-27 - 4 Rommel 12:24-25), and that is why it is said that a person can only be righteous in the sight of God by grace and not by the works of any law, even if it is the law given by Moses to the children of Jacob (Romans 3:27-31 - 4:1-5,6-14). The exact understanding of the message of Jesus Christ makes it possible to acquire the highest level of the purity of the spirit (John 8:58 - 10:30 - Galatians 4:1-6 - Ephesians 3:5-12 - Romans 15:8-12 - Acts 14:8-18 - Colossians 2:8-10), but there is a holy spirit of ignorance which can exist today in the heart of the one who has not yet understood all the revelation of Jesus Christ, and this holy spirit of ignorance existed in the world before the arrival of Jesus Christ. And there are different levels of purity of the spirit in the holy spirit of ignorance, and also in the holy spirit of the knowledge of Jesus when we consider the succession of events that have occurred in the life of the apostle Peter, according to the following explanation. Over time there was first the patriarchs who had received by one of their ancestors the habit of offering the sacrifices of animals to God alone because they knew that he exists as a distinct person [and this is indeed the case with the holy spirit], namely the burnt offerings which are offerings that no one eats, but they knew that doing good to God also consists in doing good to others since Jacob made a promise in Genesis 28:16-22 and he certainly fulfilled that promise when we read Genesis 27:41-46 - 28:1-5 - 35:1-7,27-29. And later the people who came out of Egypt received the ten commandments which made it possible to reach a greater level of purity of the spirit, and all the people had been gathered at the foot of mountain Sinai to hear the voice of God pronounce these ten commandments. But the people committed a transgression by forcing Aaron, the brother of Moses, to make a golden calf for them to worship while Moses had gone up into the mountain, and in response they have received several other commandments including the introduction of a house of God that had an educational purpose (4 Rommel 7:16-20) since they had desired a God whom they could see with their eyes. And God did not reject them all partly because they did not all have the same guilt since there were children among them, and also because he wanted to give utility to the miracles that he performed in the eyes of the Egyptians to allow Moses to lead the people out, and also because he was looking for a way to perpetuate the personal legacies of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. And later during the life in the flesh of Jesus Christ, he announced that the day of the sabbath had been included in the ten commandments so that he may come to demonstrate the power of the holy spirit (Luke 6:1-5,6-11 - 13:10-17 - Ezekiel 20:12 - 1 Rommel 3:5), and this announcement allowed his disciples to reach another level of purity of the spirit (John 15:1-3 - Acts 18:24-28). And even after his resurrection and before his ascension to heaven, Jesus allowed his disciples once again to reach a higher level of purity of the spirit which could have consisted in realizing that the burnt offerings which one offers to God alone are useless, since they understood that if a person commits a sin by offending another person then the forgiveness of such a sin can be done without the intermediary of a priest who is a descendant of Aaron (John 20:21-23 - 2 Corinthians 2:10-11). This is where the Holy Spirit of the knowledge of Jesus begins for a person who is accustomed to practicing the law given by Moses to the children of Jacob, but Peter does not yet understand the meaning of the words of Jesus concerning the notion of eternal life (Luke 20:34-38 - John 11:23-26 - Acts 1:4-8) and therefore he wants to choose a twelfth apostle without waiting for the coming of the Holy Spirit as Jesus asked them to wait (Acts 1:12-15,16-26), and Peter did not commit a sin in doing this because he wanted to do what was good according to what he knew. And it is after the departure of the resurrected Jesus that much more will be understood about the complexity of his message by certain people who will then know that God does not want to know what a child of Israel is doing but why that child of Israel is doing it (Acts 2:1-4 - 4:1-7,8-12,13-20,21-31 - 5:12-20,21-29). They will understand that the commandment of Jesus who has asked to love one's neighbor as oneself means that one must do nothing in a publicly unjustifiable way and one must seek the good of others in everything that is done, but this will not yet be the highest level of purity of their spirits since the fact that the temple of God is not yet destroyed prevents them from understanding that in eternal life a person who is Jewish is indistinguishable from a person who is not Jewish. These disciples of Jesus know that the temple of God no longer has a spiritual purpose, but they believe that the Jews are distinguished in a certain way, at least by the commandment of circumcision given to Abraham and later described by Moses in the book of Genesis. It is possible that some people like Stephen have understood that this distinction is no longer necessary and have thus reached the highest level of the purity of the spirit (John 7:37-39,40-46 - Acts 7), but this was not the case for everyone. For it was after all those events that Peter understood that even the distinction between pure food and impure food is not imposed by the Spirit (Acts 10:9-20), and that even those who are not Jews can receive the same Holy Spirit (Acts 10:1-8,25-45 - 11:1-18,19-21 - 4 Rommel 6:38), and some Jews have thus reached a higher level of the purity of the spirit. But the temple of the Jews, which is the only structure built to contain the unique altar of incense and the altar of burnt offerings (1 Rommel 3:37), has continued to exist throughout the life of some of the apostles. For the apostles were not supposed to know the moment when the destruction of this temple would occur, namely the time of the end of the existence of the tribe of Levi in the eyes of all Jews among whom some have already accepted that the message taught by Jesus comes from the God of Moses (Deuteronomy 10:5-9 - 18:1-8 - Acts 4:32-37 - 6:1-7). The apostle Peter lived while the temple of God still existed (Acts 3:1-26 - 5:12-20), and the apostle John lived much longer (4 Rommel 12:53-56). And the apostle Paul was converted by a direct call from Jesus Christ in a vision at a time when Peter and John and the other ten had already been serving as apostles for some time, or rather he had a revelation a short time after he was converted through Ananias (Acts 9:10-20 - Galatians 1:11-20), and the apostle Paul lived while the temple of God still existed, but the apostle Paul had reached the highest level of the purity of the spirit because he had understood that God does not want to know if a person is Jewish or not Jewish but is only interested in why a person does something and not in what that person does (4 Rommel 2:27-28 - 12:50-52 - 1 Corinthians 9:19-27 - 4 Rommel 6:33-35 - 11:22). So the apostles have understood everything with regard to the implementation of faith, and the understanding of Peter was gradual and continued even after the day of Pentecost, and it seems to me that the understanding of Paul was complete a short time after his miraculous conversion (Acts 22:12-21 - Galatians 2:7-9), but none of them had understood everything with regard to the exact definition of eternal life and that is why they had strange discussions (Acts 15:1-32 - 17:1-7,8-14 - 28:17-24,25-29 - Romans 4:6-17) including the trial of Paul before the Romans (Acts 24–26). It is remarkable that it is the Romans who will destroy the temple of God because of a revolt of those who do not believe in Jesus among the Jews, as in the past Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had destroyed the first temple built by Solomon because of a revolt of Zedekiah the last king of Judah. [Now the purpose of the scriptures is to make people understand how to put into practice the holy commandment given by Jesus Christ, and the meditation on the scriptures allows one to acquire the highest level of purity of spirit (Galatians 2:19). The Holy Spirit was transmitted in two different ways during the first days of Christianity. Either by intentional physical contact with a person who already had the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:14-22 - 9:17-18 - 19:1-6), or by listening and acquiring a good understanding of the teaching of Jesus Christ (Acts 10:34-45 - 11:12-16 - 15:7-11 - 1 Corinthians 1:17-18 - Galatians 4:19) which completes the teachings of the Jewish Bible in which Ezekiel has contradicted Moses regarding the things that one must offer only to God. No one is born with the knowledge of the notion of righteousness that was introduced into the world by Jesus Christ (4 Rommel 14:1-4), or at least no ordinary person, and therefore this knowledge must be acquired by some means. What we know about Jesus is that he lived without doing anything in a publicly unjustifiable way, and he was killed unjustly, and he rose from the dead and is now alive among us. And if a person understands the meaning of this knowledge and chooses by his own will to become a righteous person, then this person does the following thing: he inwardly kills his old self that he had before, a death that recalls the death of Jesus of Nazareth, and he inwardly begins a new life for God as Jesus rose from the dead and is now alive through the information that we have regarding the message that he has created in the world (Romans 6:1-14,15-23 - Galatians 2:20-21 - Colossians 2:11-17 - Acts 5:27-39).]
38 Since every person is born without a precise knowledge of the notion of God, we can read the chapters three and four and six of the book of Daniel and wonder what the world would look like if the story of Jesus Christ had never been told to anyone (4 Rommel 14:1-4 - John 15:1-3,4-12). For this story of Jesus Christ was even known by the creators of other religions like Islam (4 Rommel 2:35-39,40-42), in the same way that certain Greek philosophers who lived before Jesus Christ might have been influenced by the teachings of the Jewish prophets (3 Rommel 1:55-57 - 5 Rommel 13:8). [Now if a person only knows that he must practice the holy commandment in order to be righteous, then that does not make this person a disciple of Jesus because it is also necessary to understand how to practice the holy commandment in order to be indwelt by the Holy Spirit. And the understanding of how to behave in order to practice the holy commandment comes from some of the commandments given to Moses and from the biblical accounts (Ephesians 2:20-22 - 4 Rommel 4:8).] 
39 All this justifies the need for a revision of the Bible.
