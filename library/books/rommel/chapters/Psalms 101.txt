1 A psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and righteousness. I will sing praises to you, O Yahweh. 
2 I will behave wisely, for I will walk in your way until you come to me. I will walk in the uprightness of my heart wherever I go. 
3 I will not set any wicked thing before my eyes. I hate the work of sinners, it will not cling to me. 
4 A perverse heart will depart from me, I will have nothing to do with the wicked.
5 I will rebuke him who slanders his neighbor in secret. I will not endure him who has haughty eyes and a proud heart. 
6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, so that they may dwell around me. He who walks in a blameless way, he will be my servant. [I David, the king, will use him to do my work] 
7 He who works deceit will not dwell in my house. He who speaks lies will not remain in my sight. [He who does all these things without acceptable justification in his heart will be exposed by God and I will remove him from me.] 
8 Every morning, I [David who has been made king] will destroy all the wicked of the land. And thus I will cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Yahweh.
