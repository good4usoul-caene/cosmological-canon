1 Ephraim feeds himself with the wind, and follows the east wind [that is to say, they are wasting their time since they do not conform to my teaching]. Every day they multiply lies and violence. They make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. 
2 Yahweh has also a controversy with Judah. Yahweh will punish Jacob according to his ways, he will recompense Jacob according to his doings. 
3 In the womb Jacob grabbed his brother by the heel, and in his strength he fought with God. 
4 Jacob fought with the angel, and prevailed. And Jacob wept, and made supplication to him. And he found him in Bethel, and there he spoke concerning us. 
5 It was Yahweh the God of the armies, his name is Yahweh. 
6 Therefore turn to your God. Keep mercy and justice, and hope continuously in your God. 
7 Ephraim is a merchant who has false scales in his hand, he loves to deceive. 
8 And Ephraim said: What is certain is that I am becoming richer. I have made me a fortune, and it is entirely the product of my work. No one will know about my crimes. No one will know about my sins. 
9 But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt. I will make you dwell in tents again, as in the days of the solemn feast. 
10 I have spoken to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions. I have shown the prophets what things are going to look like. 
11 But there is iniquity in Gilead. Surely they have become worthless. They sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal, and their altars are like heaps of stones in the furrows of the fields. 
12 Jacob fled into the land of Syria, and Israel worked there to get a wife, and he kept sheep to get another wife. 
13 And Yahweh used a prophet to bring Israel out of Egypt, he used a prophet to preserve Israel. 
14 Ephraim has angered Yahweh bitterly. Therefore the [innocent] blood that he has poured will be brought on him, his Lord will make him bear his shame.
