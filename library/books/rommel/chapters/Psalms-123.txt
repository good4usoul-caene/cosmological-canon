1 I lift up my eyes to you, the one who sits in the heavens. 
2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look at the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maidservant look at the hand of her mistress, thus our eyes look at Yahweh our God to implore his mercy. 
3 Have mercy on us, O Yahweh, have mercy on us. For we have suffered a lot of contempt. 
4 Our soul is too full of the mockery of the rich and the contempt of the proud.
