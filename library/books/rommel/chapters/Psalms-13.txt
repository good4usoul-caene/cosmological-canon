1 A psalm of David. How long, O Yahweh. Will you forget me forever. How long will you hide your face from me. 
2 How much longer should I wonder how to regain peace of mind. For I am tired in my heart every day. How long will my enemy be exalted against me. 
3 Look and hear me, O Yahweh my God. Give light to my eyes, so that my sleep not be as hopeless as the sleep of the dead. 
4 Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him. Lest my adversaries rejoice when I stumble. 
5 But I trust in your mercy. My heart rejoices in your salvation. 
6 I will sing to Yahweh, because he was kind enough to reveal himself to me.
