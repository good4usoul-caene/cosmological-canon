1 The pedagogy initiated through Moses (Isaiah 1:2-3 - 2 Corinthians 3:12-18), first part.
2 The necessarily imperfect laws enunciated through Moses were deliberately evil (Ezekiel 20:25) for some of those that occurred after revolts offending the holy spirit (Exodus 20:18-23 - Deuteronomy 5:22-29,30-33). [# Among the statutes that were not good in those days when the exact identity of God was still unknown, there was the fact that there was to be no mixing of the inheritances of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel (1 Rommel 3:26-27 - Numbers 36:6-9), membership in a tribe being determined by the fact that the paternal genealogy goes back to one of the twelve sons of Jacob whose name was changed in Israel. This separation could have existed geographically from the beginning (Numbers 26:52-56) but it has not be done thus (3 Rommel 1:35). # There was also the obligation to perform in the future all rituals at a single place that will be chosen from one of the tribes of Israel (Deuteronomy 12:5-8,9-26 - 4 Rommel 12:18 - 1 Rommel 3:40 - 1 Chronicles 17:1-2 - 21:15-27,28-30 - 22:1-2 - John 4:45 - 11:55), despite the fact that the tribe of the Levites which contains the family of the priests has cities scattered throughout all the tribes of Israel (Numbers 35:1-8). But this obligation which was at the origin of the transgression of the kingdom of Israel (1 Kings 12:26-31 - 2 Chronicles 11:1-12,13-17 - 13:1-12 - 2 Kings 13:1-13 - 14:23-27 - 17:21-23 - Amos 4:1-5,6-13) was a good thing if we consider the fact that the introduction of a house of God with specific operating laws is the answer given to a transgression (Jeremiah 7:21-24 - Leviticus 21:16-24 - 1 Rommel 3:16-17,24-25 - What is the use of the Nazirites when there are on the one hand the priests the sons of Aaron and all the other Levites to work in the sanctuary of Yahweh, and on the other hand the prophets chosen by the spirit to speak the words of Yahweh - Jeremiah 5:30-31 - Haggai 1:12-15 - 2:1-5 - Zechariah 7:1-3 - Deuteronomy 18:15-19,20-22 - Numbers 6:1-8,9-12,13-18,19-21 - Amos 2:11-12 -  But in those days one could take the nazirite vow in the hope of being chosen by the spirit of God to become a prophet - Numbers 6:22-27 - 15:37-41), and therefore it is supposed to disappear when the people will have received the perfect knowledge of the exact identity of Yahweh (2 Rommel 7 - John 1:29-34 - Acts 1:1-5,6-8 - Acts 20:24-28,29-35 - John 8:29-32). It is easy to note that the things that should be done in the temple of Yahweh had a pedagogical nature (4 Rommel 7:13-20,21-24 - 3 Rommel 2:28-29,30-32 - John 1:10-14 - 1 Rommel 1:37), and even before the disappearance of the temple there has been creation of assemblies in the various places of the dwellings of the people in order to teach the exact knowledge of Yahweh (4 Rommel 12:70 - Ephesians 4:8-13,14-24). # And among the judgments that were not good in those days was the fact of having to destroy and never rebuild any city in the territory given to the descendants of Jacob, when the inhabitants of that city willfully turned away from the will to serve the God of Israel (Deuteronomy 13:12-16,17-18 - Jeremiah 8:4-9 - John 9:26-29). Does this judgment included in the commandments given to the children of Israel not appear to be wonderful after Jesus Christ revealed the exact identity of the God of Israel (John 8:21-28 - 9:39-41). I repeat it, Yahweh is magnificent in holiness and worthy of praise (Deuteronomy 4:1-6,7-8 - 17:1-13), for I have found no theological error in the totality of the verses that I have identified as being able to be inspired by the holy spirit (Jeremiah 23:28-29). And I have absolutely not altered the five books of the Torah of Moses except by sometimes clarifying the meaning of the words, and I have almost not altered the other thirteen books of the history part (1 Rommel 3:45-46), and I have only deleted some verses and some chapters in all the other books.]
3 And they only allowed to learn the differences of things and prepare the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth who had to explain the substance of the ten commandments (Exodus 20:1-17 - Deuteronomy 4:9-13,14-19,20-24 - 5:1-21) in an environment where the various forms of idolatry were suppressed to the maximum (Exodus 31:12-18 - Numbers 15:29-36 - Ezekiel 20:12 - Luke 6:6-11 - 13:10-17 - John 9:1-5,6-16 - 10:17-21 - 5 Rommel 5:17-22 - 7:19-22 - 2 Corinthians 5:19-21). For it must be considered that among all the commandments given to Moses, those that did not only specify the nuances that must be considered when putting the ten commandments into practice (Exodus 21:28-29 - Job 32:1-3,4-10 - 5 Rommel 5:40 - 7:9 - 3 Rommel 2:24-25) were in fact a response concerning the golden calf which made Yahweh angry (3 Rommel 1:46-47), because all the people had heard the voice of Yahweh without seeing an image near the mountain (1 Rommel 3:21-23 - 1 Kings 8:9,18-21 - 2 Chronicles 5:10 - 6:10-11). [Now Jesus has not asked to seek to reproduce the actions that he has done (John 13:12-15), but rather to seek to obey the commandment to which he has obeyed (John 13:34-35 - 14:15 - 15:12,17 - Luke 6:31 - 10:16 - John 13:16,20 - 4 Rommel 11:32-39 - 12:53-56). For the one who believes in Jesus (John 8:30-31 - 12:44-45,46-47 - 14:22-24 - 15:10-11 - 1 John 2:3-6 - Luke 6:46-49) cannot seek to reproduce each of the actions that he has done, and this fact can be understood through the following two realities. On the one hand, at each feast of the Jews, or at least during certain occurrences of some of the feasts instituted in the law of Moses (John 2:12-13 - 7:1-3 - 13:1) and during an occurrence of the feast of Dedication which is a celebration not existing in the law of Moses but related to certain events that had occurred during the improvement of the construction of the temple (John 10:22-24), Jesus has come in the place of the temple of the Jewish people where was the altar of the burnt offerings that the law of Moses asked to offer to God alone, and where was also the only altar of incense (Luke 1:5-10 - 1 Rommel 3:37), and this temple was placed in Jerusalem since the time of Solomon king of Israel (Deuteronomy 12:5-8,9-26 - 4 Rommel 12:18 - 1 Rommel 3:40 - 1 Chronicles 17:1-2 - 21:15-27,28-30 - 22:1-2 - John 4:45 - 11:55). And on the other hand, Jesus has taught that this unique temple of the rituals of the Jewish people, which is not the only place of teaching of the knowledge of God in those days (4 Rommel 12:70), will not continue to exist in future generations (John 2:14-21 - 4:19-21 - Luke 21:1-8).]
4 The following things happened before the destruction of their temple (Deuteronomy 32:1-12 - Isaiah 28:8-16). 
5 If the incomparable Moses died at the age of one hundred and twenty years without entering the promised land (Deuteronomy 32:45-52 - 34:1-12), after leading the people for forty years in the wilderness (Exodus 7:1-7 - Numbers 33:1-5,36-41).
6 It is because God is not in a physically perceptible destination but rather in the quality of the journey (Numbers 20:1-13 - 35:15-34). 
7 He who lives physically can hope to obtain something after the death of his body as is implied in the books of Job and Samuel and Daniel (Job 19:23-29 - 1 Samuel 28:6-15 - Daniel 3:14-18), and a beloved of God was taken away prematurely in relation to his ascendants and descendant (Genesis 5:21-24), and Elijah also was taken away (2 Kings 2:11). 
8 And the love of God is obtained only by faith in Christ, which does not forbid honoring the Levites while the physical temple which is their place of service is not yet destroyed (Isaiah 42:1-8). 
9 This teaching became understandable only after the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth (Luke 22:66-71 - 24:18-27 - Acts 3:17-26 - 1 Timothy 1:12-13) which highlighted the coexistence between two realities that one could imagined distinct, namely the physical body and the heavenly body (Luke 24:30-32 - John 20:8-9,27-29 - 1 Peter 3:18 - Acts 8:26-29,38-40 - 10:1-8 - 12:5-11).
10 Each person always acts in accordance with one's intrinsic nature (Luke 6:41-45). 
11 And at any time in the history of the universe, our presence in eternal life (Daniel 12:2-3) is determined by our actual contribution in the genealogy of something that exists. 
12 Whether it is a physical contribution or a moral contribution (2 Samuel 21:15-22 - 1 Chronicles 20:4-8), a knowledge (Luke 20:41-44 - Ephesians 4:25-27) or material entity (Genesis 11:4 - Joshua 22:29 - 24:26-27 - 1 Samuel 2:31-36 - 6:13-18 - 2 Samuel 18:18 - Genesis 15:13-16 - Exodus 12:35-36 - Deuteronomy 23:13-14 - 2 Kings 5:15-17 - 10:9-11 - 2 Chronicles 8:11 - Deuteronomy 16:21-22). 
13 Thus, to assert that God wrote words on tablets of stone is to assert that Moses wrote it when he was completely under the influence of the spirit of God (Exodus 34:1,27-28 - Deuteronomy 10:1-5). But because of the insistence of the expressions used in the biblical narrative, it seems necessary to think that the first two tablets of the covenant that Moses broke (Exodus 32:19) were solely the work of an angel of God (Exodus 31:18 - 32:15-16 - Deuteronomy 9:9-11 - Daniel 5:3-4,5-7), and that Moses only contributed to the realization of the other two tablets of the covenant which were not broken again in the same way that David had written the plans of the immobile house of Yahweh while being under the influence of the spirit of Yahweh (1 Chronicles 28:19). [Now the particular words that Jesus has spoken in John 10:10-11,17-18 suggest that the angel who gave the ten commandments to the people, namely the one who spoke to the assembly of the children of Israel gathered at the foot of the mountain and perhaps also the one who wrote the ten commandments on the first two stone tablets that were broken by Moses, was Christ himself (5 Rommel 5:10-12 - 4 Rommel 2:62-65 - John 14:8-9 - 1 Corinthians 10:1-4). For the commandment concerning the sabbath day was given solely so that an incarnation of Christ may come to make known that the holy spirit is the true God whose role is to give us access to an eternal life that exists among us (4 Rommel 4:3-4 - 14:1-4).]
14 If we make something disappear, we will be present wherever the absence of that thing is noticed by all those who knew about it.
15 The one who has not seen corruption (Acts 13:32-39) is the one about whom there is reason to believe that he is not physically dead. 
16 Thus the great reward of those who actually retained the multiple commandments of Moses before the coming of Christ (Jeremiah 3:14-16 - 29:1-20 - 31:1-26 - Haggai 2:1-9 - Daniel 9:25-26) is the fact that they were the anonymous or famous actors of the narrative that enables us to understand God (Acts 7:44-53 - Luke 20:37-38 - Exodus 15:17-18 - 2 Samuel 7:4-11). The house of God is the body of Christ (2 Samuel 7:12-17 - Acts 20:28). 
17 And before Jesus of Nazareth, different angels of the holy spirit were able to intervene in different human communities (Daniel 4:1-18 - 5:1-30) to establish the foundations of the house of God (Luke 6:46-49 - 2 Timothy 2:14-21 - John 10:16). 
18 The practice of circumcision could not have existed as a ritual among Abraham's ancestors (Genesis 17) and was perceived by those who received it as the main symbol that distinguished them from other peoples (Genesis 34:14). 
19 The holy spirit was able to get impatient with Moses because his living conditions did not justify his disobedience to available information (Exodus 4:24-26) and the same holy spirit was patient with the people born in the wilderness (Joshua 5:1-8), a people whose hearts he has in priority circumcised (Numbers 26:63-65 - Deuteronomy 1:34-40 - 2:14-18 - 8:1-5 - 29:1-6).
20 For the people left Egypt with flocks and the majority of the commandments of Moses were given at mount Sinai from the third month of their journey until the second month of the second year (Exodus 16:1-2 - 17:1-3 - 19:1-3 - 40:17 - Leviticus 25:1 - 26:46 - 27:34 - Numbers 1:1 - 9:1 - 10:11-13). A journey that lasted forty years (Exodus 7:7 - Numbers 20:22-29 - 26:63-65 - 33:36-39 - Deuteronomy 1:1-5 - 3:18-29 - Numbers 27:12-14 - 33:47-48 - Deuteronomy 32:48-52 - 34:1-5), and during which the people often had livestock (Numbers 20:1,8 - 28:6 - 31:1-11). In any case, even during a time when they actually have livestock available, continuous morning and evening burnt offerings (Exodus 29:38-42,43-46) cannot be made until the tabernacle is installed (Amos 5:21-25 - Acts 7:38-42). For this tabernacle is dismantled and carried whenever the congregation moves (Exodus 40:36-38 - Numbers 4:1-33,49 - 9:15-23 - Deuteronomy 1:32-33 - Numbers 33:1-49).
21 The notion of sin is individual. Although those our genealogical ascendants influence the quality of the persecutions that we must endure (Exodus 34:5-7 - Numbers 14:26-32,33-35), for all the elect must be persecuted (2 Chronicles 32:31 - John 3:3-7 - 6:53 - Acts 14:22 - Romans 8:17 - 2 Corinthians 4:10-11), the word child in the Hebrew Bible does not always refer to the bond of flesh and blood but rather to the bond of the spirit. 
22 Our children are the ones who include us in the effective chain of transmission of information that they use daily to effect their own accomplishments in other words those who appreciate and imitate our achievements (Genesis 25:21-26 - Malachi 1:1-3 - Ezekiel 37:25 - Genesis 35:10-12 - Luke 1:35 - John 8:38-41,42-44). 
23 Thus, Caleb was not a descendant of Abraham according to the flesh but rather the son of a Kenizzite (Genesis 15:18-19 - Exodus 12:37-38) and yet he inherited the promise (Genesis 17:5-8 - 26:1-6 - Deuteronomy 1:34-38 - Numbers 32:10-13 - 34:16-19 - Joshua 14:6-14). 
24 The strange choice of the symbol that the people had to observe (Numbers 21:4-9 - John 3:14-16) to be healed after offending the holy spirit (Exodus 17:1-7 - Numbers 11:1-23,31-34 - 14:1-5,22-24 - 20:1-13 - 21:1-5) was an illustration of the fact that the optimization of our heavenly body is achieved by obtaining forgiveness of our sins only from those who have been wronged without any publicly acceptable justification. Consequently, their healings were effected by the image of what God the Father used to manifest their sin against God the holy spirit. 
25 It is permissible to use cunning to solve a problem fairly, but it is forbidden to design traps to cause the fall of a person who acts out of ignorance (Leviticus 19:14-18 - 2 Kings 10:18-28 - 1 Kings 3:23-25 - 2 Samuel 14:1-20 - Deuteronomy 1:16-17). 
26 It was not the foreigner who was excluded from the assembly of Israel (Ezra 10:1-3 - Nehemiah 13:23-28) but only idolatry (Ezra 9:1-2 - Nehemiah 13:29-31 - Deuteronomy 20:14-18). 
27 For the pedagogy given to Moses simply recommends avoiding being drawn into idolatry (Exodus 34:11-16 - Deuteronomy 7:1-9) and the holy race is not defined by genealogical ties (Deuteronomy 21:10-17 - Ruth 1:4,16 - 4:13-17 - Judges 21:5-15,16-22 - Joshua 8:30-35 - 13:7-13 - 15:63 - 16:10 - 17:12-13 - 3 Rommel 2:29). 
28 Thus, God’s Israel does not triumph because of its righteousness but because of the ignorance of the adversary (Deuteronomy 9:1-14) that is why they must attack only their enemies (Esther 9:1-2,16 - Deuteronomy 20:1,10-12) after having offered them peace (Deuteronomy 2:24-33 - Joshua 11:19-20). In the same way that the children of Jacob were attached to God only during certain periods (Judges 2), one can think that some of the nations who lived in their midst had a similar behavior in their relations with the holy spirit (Joshua 21:43-45 - 23:1-16). 
29 For one who is not guilty of wrongdoing is not attacked with impunity (Exodus 17:8-16 - Deuteronomy 25:17-19). 
30 There has always existed a part of God’s Israel which was not geographically identifiable and which was never under the pedagogical law chosen to welcome the incarnate Christ, that is why this law authorized conversions (Numbers 15:13-16,29-31 - Exodus 12:48-49 - Leviticus 24:17-22) and indicated that it is a sin to count the people with the sole criterion of belonging to the Israel of God (Exodus 30:11-15 - 2 Samuel 24:1-10 - 1 Chronicles 21:1-8 - 27:23-24 - Romans 10:6-7). [And one can note that the people who received the covenant of the ten commandments three months after their departure from the land of Egypt were not only descendants of Jacob according to the flesh. (Exodus 12:37-38 - 19:1-7,8-17 - Numbers 11:1-4).]
31 But David had not been personally guilty of the numbering initiated because he was unaware of the exact identities of Christ and of the God of Israel so that this trial appears as a pretext for God the Father to judge the people (Judges 20 - Ezekiel 18:30 - Exodus 32:33). 
32 However, it was not an offense to the holy spirit to count the personnel of the army (Numbers 1:1-3,17-19,45-49 - 26:1-4,51-53) or the members of the tribe of Levi because of their special function among the people (Numbers 1:50-54 - 3:14-16,39 - 26:57-62,63-65 - 1 Chronicles 23:1-3,25-27 - Numbers 8:22-26). [During the days of Moses, when the Levites had just received the function of transporting the sanctuary of Yahweh, the plans of which were shown to Moses because this structure did not exist before (5 Rommel 9:14-17 - Exodus 25:9,40 - 26:30 - 39:42-43), the Levites were numbered from the age of one month to know their total (Numbers 3:14-16,39 - 26:57-62,63-65) or from the age of thirty to transport the tabernacle (Numbers 4:34-49), and they could serve in the different parts of the sanctuary from the age of twenty five (Numbers 8:22-26). And David changed the age of service of the Levites because they would no longer have to carry the tarbernacle built by Moses, since his son Solomon had to build a stationary house to place the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and also to contain the altar of the burnt offerings (1 Chronicles 23:1-3,25-27).]
33 The only thing that must attract the eye when one observes a child of Israel is the holy spirit and no other fantasy (Jeremiah 9:23-26 - Leviticus 19:26-28 - Deuteronomy 14:1 - 22:11-12 - Luke 8:43-44). 
34 Consequently, Paul’s recommendations on dress in assemblies serve only to prevent extravagance (1 Corinthians 11:1-16) as lust of the eyes can lead to undesirable effects (1 Corinthians 11:17). 
35 The apostle Paul is simply trying to create a form of school of faith (Romans 10:9 - Galatians 4:19 - 5:14 - 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 - Philippians 1:15-18 - Luke 5:36-39) for people who have not yet reached spiritual maturity (Luke 6:39 - Ephesians 4:7-16). And it provides for a form of remuneration for those who are devoted to this exercise where the need arises from lack of knowledge (Galatians 6:6 - Jeremiah 31:33-34), and the need to create such assemblies is also imposed by the beliefs of the peoples at the time of the birth and propagation of the Christian faith (John 16:1-3 - 1 Thessalonians 2:13-16 - Acts 14:21-23,24-28 - 19:23-36). 
36 Prayer only serves to strengthen the believer in one’s attachment to the holy commandment (Genesis 32:3-6,7-12,13-23 - 2 Kings 18:33-37 - 19:1-5 - 2 Chronicles 32:1-8 - Nehemiah 1:1-11 - 2:1-20 - 4:6-21 - Daniel 9:1-2,3-19 - 2 Samuel 7:18-27,28-29). This is why we must think that Jesus’ prayer for the fulfilment of the mission of Simon Peter (Luke 22:31-32) could have occurred when designing this mission (Jeremiah 1:4-5 - John 1:1-3 - 8:56-59). And in John 17 Jesus prays a prayer whose sole purpose is to strengthen the disciples who hear it and to make them understand the purpose of a prayer, since all the things he says and asks for in this prayer are things that he has already explained beforehand that they will happen. The apostle Paul does not think otherwise about prayer (Philippians 4:6-9 - 2 Thessalonians 3:1-5,6-16 - Acts 20:28-35), but he intends to create a form of school to perpetuate the message of Jesus (4 Rommel 6:33-35 - 11:22) so that it may not be easily forgotten in all future generations who will certainly transgress in different ways as it has been since the beginning of the history of the chosen people (Judges 2:7-11 - John 2:23-25), and that is why he chose a particular vocabulary which can be misinterpreted but whose misinterpretation does not cause much harm to others (2 Peter 3:15-16 - 5 Rommel 7:23-24 - 12:27-29). And the gospel of Luke does not say a different thing (Luke 18:1-8 - 5 Rommel 12:10-15), and the gospel of John does not say a different thing (3 Rommel 2:2 - 5 Rommel 12:16-18). 
37 In the book of God the Father we are now on the sixth day of creation (Exodus 32:32-33 - Ephesians 2:10) and the pedagogical laws (Galatians 3:19) were not known before Moses in the form of a divine commandment (Genesis 17:10-14,22-27 - Numbers 27:1-11 - 36:1-10). 
38 The classification of animals that might have existed for some communities (Genesis 7:1-2 - 8:20) was derived from the criteria established by human intelligence (Genesis 1:29 - 9:1-3). For the angels of the holy spirit can circumstantially confirm certain human initiatives (Exodus 18:13-27 - Deuteronomy 16:18-20 - 17:8-13). But these angels are not the holy spirit itself, the God of Israel (Acts 10:9-20 - 11:1-18 - John 1:18).
39 The angels of the holy spirit no longer announce prophecies about events that must occur in future generations but rather the things on which it is possible to act now (Acts 8:26-29 - 10:1-8 - 11:27-30 - 20:22-23 - 21:9-14). 
40 The last prophet who had this gift (Luke 16:16) symbolically performed a water baptism (Luke 3:1-16 - John 1:25-28 - 3:22-26 - 4:1-2 - Acts 1:5 - 11:16 - 19:1-7) in order to allow people to publicly commit to renouncing bad deeds, that is to say, to publicly commit to cling to good deeds (Luke 3:21-22 - John 1:32-34). [Now what John asks the people is not to seek to do good only according to the quantities prescribed in the law, but to take personal initiatives for well being to others.]
41 And this increased the information that the holy spirit and all the other people who know that this baptism took place would henceforth use to judge each person who has been publicly baptized, but such a commitment can also be done alone and in private. 
42 The meaning of the word baptism not being trivial (Luke 3:16 - 12:49-51 - John 1:33 - Acts 1:4-5 - 11:15-16 - 4 Rommel 7:20 - 11:16) and being absent from the conditions that are necessary to access eternal life (1 John 5:11-13 - Luke 10:25-28 - John 3:3-7 - 6:47-51 - 13:34-35 - 5 Rommel 13:14-16).
43 The water baptism of John did not call into question the existence of the tribe of Levites and the temple (John 1:6-8 - 1 Peter 3:21-22) which are suppressed only by the baptism of the holy spirit carried out by Jesus of Nazareth through the announcement of the exact identity of the God of Israel (John 1:29-33,34-36 - Acts 18:24-28 - 19:1-4 - Galatians 3:27 - Romans 6:3-4 - Ephesians 4:4-6 - 1 Corinthians 1:14-31 - 1 Rommel 1:37) which brings together all human communities, individual by individual (Genesis 18:18-19 - Ezekiel 33:23-29 - Galatians 3:22-29). [Now the only thing that the holy spirit of God does is build a useful personal legacy to each person who chooses to obey him blindly. But in those days the Jews do not suspect that their privileged place of worship, the existence of which was instituted by Moses, will disappear to make them similar to the Greeks and to the rest of humanity regarding the method of worship of the God who created all things (John 7:28-36). And John the Baptist did not reveal the exact identity of God because he himself did not know what it is (Luke 7:11-17,18-23), because the revelation of this information was reserved for Jesus of Nazareth (John 3:30-36 - Acts 1:4-5 - 4 Rommel 8:15). The Holy Spirit is obtained only once in a lifetime when one understands what must be done and does it (4 Rommel 1:19-22 - 12:12-15 - 5 Rommel 12:19-24), that is to say, when one goes to those whom one has offended in a publicly unjustifiable way in the past to acknowledge one's transgressions and obtain their forgiveness if possible, and one makes the firm inner resolution to no longer offend anyone in a publicly unjustifiable way. Now the water baptism initiated by John the Baptist later became a baptism in the name of Jesus Christ or equivalently in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, and we see that this public commitment to cling to what is right and fair according to the known information was made even before the acquisition of the holy spirit as it was when it was created (Acts 8:9-16,17-25 - 19:1-7), and it could also be done after the acquisition of the holy spirit (Acts 9:10-18 - 10:42-48 - 11:12-17). This is because a person can receive a water baptism of John or another improved form of this same public declaration (4 Rommel 12:60) every time that he arrives in a new community, and it is for the sole purpose of conveying the following message to all other members of that community: I have received knowledge of the moral code that must guide the voluntary actions of every person, and I believe that I possess the exact knowledge of this universal moral code (2 Corinthians 10:1-5 - 1 Rommel 1:36 - 4 Rommel 14:1-4), and therefore you do not need to ask yourself whether you should still teach it to me, and therefore I am ready to receive a proportional and merciless punishment (2 Corinthians 10:6 - 5 Rommel 5:46-47) if it is established that I have committed a willful transgression of this universal moral code.]
44 The ancient Jews were saved by Jesus of Nazareth because it was explained in the Greek New Testament (Luke, John, Paul, Peter) that one is freed among other things from genealogical specificities (Numbers 18 - Deuteronomy 10:5-9 - 18:1-8 - Acts 4:32-37 - 6:1-7). An explanation similar to the one that created one’s faith (Exodus 4:28-31 - Luke 24:45-47 - John 20:30-31 - Acts 3:1-26 - 5:12-20). 
45 The Gentile was saved by Jesus of Nazareth because the faith was created or solidified by the Hebrew Bible and the Greek scriptures (Romans 15:8-12 - Colossians 1:26-27). 
46 According to the holy scriptures, even those who doubt the possibly approximate historicity of the Hebrew Bible can also be saved by Jesus of Nazareth because the world around us, from which comes the information that determines behavior by imitation processes, is strongly impacted by the spread of the gospel (1 Timothy 4:10 - 5 Rommel 4:9). 
47 Because we are a new creature as soon as we choose to live by faith (2 Corinthians 5:17-21), it is simply appropriate to state that our sins are then forgiven or that they are carried by the process that allowed us to acquire faith, that is to say, Jesus of Nazareth (Isaiah 53 - Ephesians 1). 
48 Likewise, when it is stated that Jesus sits at the right hand of God in the heavenly places, it is simply an appropriate formula to summarize Luke 16:16. And I think that Luke 16:17 refers to the timeless law, the holy commandment (John 14:15 - 15:12,17), because it is easy to see that Moses' commandments were a form of pedagogy (4 Rommel 7:13-20,21-24 - 3 Rommel 2:28-29,30-32), and also because Jesus speaks with parables (4 Rommel 8:15 - 5 Rommel 7:10-15). 
49 By proclaiming themselves different, they oppose the holy spirit and in addition they take away from the holy spirit those whom they manage to convince by usurping the place of Jesus Christ in their hearts. 
50 There is fulfillment of Exodus 19:4-6 - Numbers 12:1-2 - 16:1-3. And this could not be achieved during the time of the pedagogy. 
51 Now it is no longer possible to recognize, according to their paternal houses, the ten lost tribes (2 Kings 17:1-23 - 1 Chronicles 5:10,18-26). And the promised land will therefore be shared equally among the members of the Israel of God (Ezekiel 47:13-23 - Zechariah 2:1-5,10-13 - Joel 2:28-32 - Luke 24:45-47 - Acts 2:16-38 - Ephesians 2:13-22).
52 What is important is the commandment of Christ and not the various feasts based on the sighting of the moon [the only means available for measuring time on a large scale and demarcating months and seasons] which are instituted in the pedagogical law (1 Chronicles 23:27-32 - Ezekiel 46:1-3 - Colossians 2:16-23). 
53 Thus, even the celebration of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth serves only to periodically remind future generations and those who tend to forget it of the Good News, the dispute over the precise date of the celebration having no significance and being akin to numerology which is a form of idolatry.
