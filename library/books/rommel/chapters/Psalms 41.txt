1 A psalm of David. Blessed is he who considers the weak. Yahweh will help him in the times of trouble. 
2 Yahweh will protect him and keep him alive. He will be blessed on earth, and you will not give him to the will of his enemies. 
3 Yahweh will strengthen him on the bed of sorrow. You will assuage his grief in all his diseases. 
4 Therefore I said: O Yahweh, have mercy on me and heal my soul. For I have sinned against you. 
5 My enemies speak wickedly of me by saying: When will he die. When will his name be destroyed. 
6 If someone comes to see me, then he will speak falsely. For his heart comes to gather topics to gossip about me, and then he will go to tell it. 
7 All those who hate me whisper together against me, and they plan to hurt me. 
8 He has been seriously struck. He will fall and will not rise again. 
9 My familiar friend who had my confidence and who ate my bread, the same has lifted up his heel against me. 
10 But you, O Yahweh, have mercy on me and restore me. And thus they will understand that your spirit is not to be mocked. 
11 I know that you love me, because my enemy will not triumph over me. 
12 For you will succor me because of my integrity, and you will set me before your face for ever. 
13 Blessed be Yahweh the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. So be it, so be it.
