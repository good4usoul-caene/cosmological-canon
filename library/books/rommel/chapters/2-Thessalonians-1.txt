1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
2 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
3 Brothers, we thank God for you always. And that is what we should do, because you give us good reason to be thankful. Your faith is growing more and more, and the love that all of you have for one another is increasing. 
4 Therefore we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God, because of your patience and faith in all the persecutions and tribulations that you are enduring. 
5 It is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, so that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God for which you are suffering. 
6 For it is a righteous thing in the sight of God, who will repay with affliction those who afflict you. 
7 And he will grant you who are afflicted rest with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire. 
8 To inflict vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
9 They will suffer the punishment of everlasting destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power. 
10 When he comes in that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be made marvelous among all those who have believed, and this includes you because you have believed what we have told you. 
11 For this reason, we also pray continually for you, so that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill by his power every good purpose of yours and every work of your faith. 
12 So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
