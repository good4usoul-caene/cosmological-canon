1 Theological vocabulary (Luke 1:31-33 - John 8:51), second part: Ultimate revelation.
2 The only will of the creator of all things (God the Father) in the life of men is obedience to the holy spirit. And to transmit this teaching to men there were many prophets but the one who had the main and essential role was Jesus of Nazareth also called Son of God or Son of man (John 8:28 - Luke 13:18-21 - Acts 17:22-34). 
3 So we have God the Father, and God the Son, and God the holy spirit. 
4 The first chapter of the book of Genesis summarizes the story of creation and from the second chapter onwards it is about highlighting selected events for our instructions. 
5 Throughout the Hebrew Bible God blesses or curses different characters by promising them that particular events will occur sometimes during their lives in the flesh, but very often after the death of their bodies (Genesis 15:1-6 - 17:1-8 - Exodus 34:5-7 - Deuteronomy 25:17-19 - 1 Kings 21:27-29 - Jeremiah 22:24-30 - 2 Samuel 7:22-29 - Nehemiah 9:6-8). And each person receives particular promises according to his personal relationship with God, that is to say, according to his attachment to the spirit of justice which includes his obedience to the will of God of which he has knowledge (Exodus 32:33 - Deuteronomy 24:16 - Ecclesiastes 6:1-6 - 1 Kings 8:25 - 9:1-9). 
6 And Jesus of Nazareth came to explain to the Jews that he announces a good news to all mankind. It is that no one dies because each person is mathematically and physically connected to the totality of his or her accomplishments in the world. The kingdom of God is in our midst (Luke 17:20-21 - 20:37-38 - 1 John 3:2-3 - Acts 25:19). 
7 His resurrection, a phenomenon already noted as being strange in the Jewish scriptures (Genesis 5:21:24 - 2 Kings 2:1-18 - 13:20-21), demonstrates the existence of eternal life (Acts 1:1-11) and makes us understand the means to access it (1 Peter 1:18-21 - John 3:16). 
8 Just imitate his behavior by clinging to the holy spirit in all circumstances (John 13:34-35). 
9 His words were spoken and written to comfort and sustain us in the midst of different trials. And if I obey his teaching, then I become the new form of his body and he becomes my spirit (Romans 8:9) because I have included him in the effective chain of transmission of information that I use to carry out my own realizations (John 14:22-24). 
10 All the creators of sects and cults (2 Peter 2:15-19 - John 8:32) want to use you to give a place to their own heavenly body and to achieve this goal they must be directly responsible for a knowledge that you proudly use regularly in your life. 
11 Either there are very small things to perform such as praying in a special way at particular times in addition to other prayers that may come from your own initiative, or practicing fasts on certain days of the week that have been chosen for you. Or they insist on certain vocabularies to be used systematically when the circumstances are favorable, or on the supposed exact spelling of certain expressions. Or they impose to have a significant utility in some of the most important events in your life, such as contributing to the choice of your life partner and ensuring that this relationship in which they have a great deal of responsibility produces lasting fruits (eg children). 
12 The only way to endure eternal life without going to hell (leaving others a disgusting memory as a legacy) is to consistently practice what feels right and just to you in all your interactions with others, according to the information available to you. There are no other secrets, there is no particular ritual to practice. 
13 The spirit of God is the spirit of justice and equity and this spirit can dwell in anyone who wishes but be careful, not everyone wants this and some know how to hide their intentions very well. 
14 At any given moment there are only two kinds of people in the world namely those who are only concerned with the flourishing of all mankind and those who do not care (Luke 9:50 - 11:23). 
15 Those who act out of ignorance still have the possibility of conversion (John 6:37) because every normal human being must offend the holy spirit (Psalms 32). But whoever renounces the faith after having had an exact knowledge of it, the same one is definitely cursed (Luke 12:10). 
16 False Jews, whether they are spiritual or fleshly descendants of converted peoples (Esther 8:15-17) or whether they are truly of Abraham, know that not all the prophets of scripture are of the tribe of Levi. King David of Judah spoke from God (Psalms 22), and the son of a prostitute woman was a judge in Israel (Judges 11:1-3). 
17 But they refuse to understand that the spirit of God cannot remain locked within four walls in a very holy place which only a privileged few have the right to approach according to their genealogy and function within that genealogy (Exodus 29:29-30 - 30:1-10 - Numbers 8:22-26). 
18 A holy place that was initially in a moving structure (Exodus 26:30-37 - 40:1-7 - Numbers 1:47-54) which actually moved from place to place (Joshua 18:1 - 24:25-27 - Judges 20:25-28 - 1 Samuel 1:1-3 - 21:1,6 - 1 Chronicles 21:29). It is not abnormal that during a part of the time when there was still no king in Israel to represent the people before God, the tent of meeting was often moved since all tribes were expected to be equal in the eyes of God. But from a certain time it was installed at Shiloh (Judges 18:31 - 21:19) in a structure called the temple of Yahweh because Samuel, whose father is not of the tribe of Levi, has his dwelling within (1 Samuel 1:1-2 - 3:1-3,15 - Jeremiah 7:9-15). 
19 A holy place that king David wanted to immobilize (2 Samuel 6:15-17 - 7:1-2 - 1 Chronicles 22:17-19) and that the prophet Ezekiel proposes to immortalize (Ezekiel 43:10-12 - 48:29-35). 
20 They refuse to understand that there is no particular time of day or particular days of the year to fully experience God's presence (2 Kings 4:22-23). 
21 Jacob also prophesied that his own spirit would not naturally be united with that of the Levites (Genesis 49:5-7). 
22 Indeed, what could be more petty than a Jew who considers himself to be the intermediary between God and men (1 Thessalonians 2:13-16). 
23 What is stronger than the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, and what is sweeter than Jesus of Nazareth (Judges 14:14 - 1 Corinthians 15:3-4). 
24 It is not a man who builds a house for God (Exodus 20:22-23 - Psalms 50 - 132:1-9 - Isaiah 66:1-2 - 2 Samuel 7:4-7 - 1 Chronicles 17:3-6). 
25 It is God who builds a house for those he loves [that is to say, he allows them to have a legacy that endures forever (4 Rommel 11:23 - 12:60)] in order to reward them for their devotion to the holy spirit (Genesis 6:5-13 - 2 Samuel 7:11,16 - 1 Chronicles 17:10,14 - Psalms 132:10-18). And Jesus of Nazareth had the best place in the hearts of living beings because he has clung to the holy spirit since his birth and has never turned away from it (John 8:45-52 - 4 Rommel 14:12). And God will always succeed in giving a place to every person who loves the holy spirit (# The legacy of John the Baptist had some influence in the transformation that the world underwent - Luke 3:15-16 - John 14:1-2 - 1 Peter 3:21-22  - 4 Rommel 6:43 # And those who chose to cling to the Jewish people in the days before the coming of Christ were binding their souls to the usefulness that Jewish people have had in clarifying the identity of God - 4 Rommel 7:10 # And what is eternal is the holy spirit - 4 Rommel 4:10 - 1 Peter 1:24-25), because nothing is impossible for God (Genesis 18:9-12,13-14 - Jeremiah 32:16-18,24-27).
26 And it is impossible to surprise God (John 3:27 - Isaiah 29:15-16) because everyone always acts according to one's own nature. What changes is the information available and understood and the accumulated experience. 
27 When we come into the world, we do not know how to behave in order to archive our own goal without this being followed by any unpleasant surprise through cause and effect relationships. [For each person is free to set his own goals (John 1:35-39 - 16:23-24 - Proverbs 24:17-18 - 2 Thessalonians 3:1-5,6-16 - 2 Peter 2:9-19 - 4 Rommel 12:24-25). Ezra returned to Jerusalem in the seventh year of king Artaxerxes (Ezra 7:1-7,8-10), but the will to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem is an initiative of Nehemiah who returned to the promised land in the twentieth year of king Artaxerxes (Nehemiah 1:1-11 - 2:1-20 - 8:1-6 - 13:1-6). And even among the apostles of Christ who are filled with the Holy Spirit, each one can have his own opinion concerning the solution that is suitable in a particular context to achieve the only objective which is the glorification of the God of Israel (Acts 9:17-20 - 11:19-22,23-26 - 13:1-4 - 15:35-41 - Romans 14:1-5,6-13 - John 3:8).] 
28 Perhaps we must trust people who are rich, or old people, or very strong people, or our parents regardless of our age (2 Chronicles 21:1-5 - Judges 9:1-5 - 1 Kings 12:10 - Job 32:1-10 - 2 Chronicles 15:16-17 - 22:8-12 - 2 Kings 6:26-29,30-31 - Isaiah 2:22).
29 Maybe we have to lie to everyone when there is no constraint and simply to protect our privacy or for fun (Zechariah 8:16-17 - 1 Samuel 25:14-38 - 2 Samuel 13:10-20 - 2 Kings 5:15-27 - John 3:20-21 - Isaiah 5:8-16).
30 Maybe we have to make human sacrifices (Jeremiah 7:31 - 32:35 - Judges 11:30-40 - Deuteronomy 23:21-23 - Leviticus 27:28-29 - Ezekiel 20:25-26,30-31), or call on the dead to ask them what our behavior should be among those who are alive (1 Samuel 28:11-15), or carefully observe the brightness of the night and the configuration of the most visible stars (2 Kings 21:6) in order to achieve our own goals with a lasting satisfaction (Jeremiah 9:23-24 - Habakkuk 2 - Isaiah 5:21-24). 
31 There is only one solution which is completely revealed by Jesus of Nazareth (2 Chronicles 9:7-8 - 1 Peter 1:18-25 - John 3:16 - Colossians 1:21-23). 
32 And if the witnesses of his life and his resurrection were few it is not because God is wicked but because those who were chosen had the privilege of continuing to exist eternally by the information they transmitted to us. 
33 It should not be an absurdity to define a celestial body as being the extension of a physical body by the notion of responsibility. A child still in the womb of the mother can provoke at a moment given, while she is imagining the future, a particular smile that will be seen, through a television that has been offered to him, by someone who will feel inspired and who will therefore take such an initiative and so on and the world is exchange. 
34 The ten commandments cannot be for all mankind, God having given possessions to other human communities without giving them the ten words (Deuteronomy 2:1-12 - 5:1-4). 
35 The sabbath day was created for the explanations of Jesus of Nazareth on the true identity of God according to the apostle Paul (Colossians 2:16-23) and on this day we did not stop caring about the prosperity of others but we taught the knowledge of a God whose identity was not yet fully revealed (Luke 4:16-21 - 14:1-6 - John 7:22-29). 
36 What Jesus of Nazareth says is that on the one hand it is not the sabbath day that gives eternal life and the purpose of life is to obtain eternal life (1 Corinthians 15:45 - 1 John 1:2 - John 1:4). And on the other hand, if it is not a bad thing for a community not to systematically carry out the tasks essential to its survival every day of the week, it should not be thought that there must be a particular day of the week when we must stop worrying about the development of our neighbor. 
37 Moreover, if the tablets of stones teach that covetousness is an offense against the creator of all things, pride is not mentioned (Daniel 4:30-37 - Colossians 3:23-25 - Ephesians 2:20-22 - 2 Timothy 3:16-17).
38 Jesus did not say: Carry a cross, walk a path with it and be crucified once a year or once in your life. 
39 Condition A and condition B and condition C, is different from condition A only (Leviticus 11:1-7). Also compare Luke 9:23 - 14:27 with Luke 8:10-11 - 14:34-35 - John 16:25,29. 
40 But he said: Love one another as I have loved you (John 15:12,17). 
41 If christianity consists in being a disciple of Jesus of Nazareth, the works to be accomplished by a disciple depending on the interpretations of the different movements and schools of thought, and that in addition this Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew whose teaching is based solely on the Jewish religion, then how can we deny that christianity originated from a very ancient Jewish people (Romans 10:17 - John 4:22). 
42 But all of this does not mean that christianity should continue to regard Judaism as an acceptable religion because of its origins. 
43 This would be to misunderstand the teachings because what is said is that everything was savagery on earth, even Judaism which was simply one of the less savage organizations but which was also a savagery among others (Ezekiel 46:1-3 - Galatians 3:22 - Job 35:5-8). 
44 And then a long-foretold light came into the world (Luke 13:18-21 - John 8:12). And he who does not receive this light is an outcast (Luke 9:50 - 11:23). 
45 Judaism is indeed a religion which is centered on two hereditary things transmitted only at birth, namely belonging to the tribe of Levi and being a legitimate successor of Aaron. 
46 And after the message of Jesus Christ some authors, among whom were Matthew and Mark who designed their books to make christianity unbearable for anyone interested in the foundation which is the Hebrew Bible, and also James, wanted to save something (Deuteronomy 23:1-8 - Numbers 5:11-31 - 36:5-13) that must disappear (Hosea 6:6 - 14:1-2 - Isaiah 66:3).
47 For the true holy of holies (Exodus 26:33-34) is in the heart and everyone is a Jew in the eyes of God (Exodus 20:22-23 - Joel 2:28-32 - Romans 2:28-29). 
48 The spirit of prophecy (Ezekiel 1:1-3), which distributes different gifts to different people (1 Corinthians 12:4-12), is the testimony of Jesus-Christ (John 3:17-21) and even the falsifications know it as in the following extract. 
49 And the angel said to me, Write this, Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb. And the angel said to me, These are true words of God. And I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me: Be careful not to do it. I am your companion in service, and that of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (Revelation 19:9-10). 
50 In the early days of Christianity, a follower of Christ who was not a Jew did not necessarily have to behave like a follower of Christ who was a Jew. 
51 For the latter could continue to give the hereditary tribe of Levi their means of sustenance while Paul tells the non-Jew that the true temple God is not this man-made house that is still standing but rather the body of Christ who is still alive (Acts 5:12-29,30-42 - 25:19). [In those days it was not easy to convince the Jews that the message of Jesus came from the God of Moses, and that is why the apostles prayed for the strength to perform miracles (Acts 6:1-7 - 8:5-8 - 9:31-35,36-42 - 13:1-12). For they had to convince the Jews that if a person commits a sin by offending another person then the forgiveness of such a sin can be done without the intermediary of a priest who is a descendant of Aaron (John 20:21-23 - Acts 4:32-37). They had to convince them that the temple of God, which has not yet been destroyed, must simply become a privileged place for teaching the message of Jesus (Acts 5:12-20,21-29). And the only thing that Jesus asked is to love one's neighbor as oneself, in other words one must do nothing in a publicly unjustifiable way and one must seek the good of others in everything that is done. For the teaching of Jesus is that there is eternal life that is accessible only through faith in his holy commandment, but even the apostles of Jesus do not know the exact definition of eternal life despite the fact that they know the only way to access it. That is why the disciples of Jesus do not intend to destroy the temple built to serve God through the commands given by Moses, but rather to explain the message of Jesus to all the Jews and gradually convince them (Acts 16:1-3 - 21:17-25,26-30 - 25:1-8,9-11 - 28:16-20,21-29 - Luke 5:36-39). And the temple will be destroyed by the Romans because of a revolt of the part of the Jews who have refused to believe in Jesus Christ and to teach his message to their children, and this is similar to the fact that the first Jewish temple built by Solomon had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon after a revolt of Zedekiah the last king of Judah.]
52 The apostle Paul teaches in a context that is not eternal and he indicated in twelve letters, out of the thirteen attributed to him and which bear his name in the introductions of the texts, that he is in charge of edifying non-Jews. 
53 Moreover, the spirit of Jesus of Nazareth was very dense in the early days of christianity because there was not yet much intermediary between the author of the message and the receiver. 
54 Today when I recite a biblical verse which is supposed to be his word, it is not only his spirit that is invoked but rather the whole chain of responsibility which allowed this knowledge to be available to me in a specific place and at a precise moment since the message of Jesus Christ is that no one dies and that the kingdom of God is among us. 
55 And these responsibilities are of various natures since there are theologians but also the printing press which published this book which I hold in hand or the manufacturer of this computer on which I am reading. 
56 But all this is not a problem because there has never been any difference between men (Deuteronomy 10:16-20 - 1 John 4:20-21) and the true eternal God is the holy spirit (Ecclesiastes 7:10-14). 
57 The special child who must forever strengthen the throne of king David (Isaiah 9:5-7) is Jesus of Nazareth whose body is the true temple of God (John 2:18-21) because when we practice his teachings we become his body (Ephesians 1:22-23) and his spirit which is also the spirit of God (John 3:34) then dwells in us (Ephesians 2:17-22 - 1 Corinthians 6:15-20). 
58 Jesus of Nazareth is the only absolutely perfect man in the eyes of God. Without this certainty one would have considered possible the theories that lend him a different bride from the church (John 3:29-34) while John the Baptist would have lived in the wilderness and then had his head cut off (Luke 1:76-80 - 3:1-6 - 9:9) or even the theories that attribute to him children according to the flesh so as to attenuate the perfect beauty of his celestial body (1 Corinthians 7:7-8 - Isaiah 54:1-5).  
59 The God of Israel is triune because the creative Father is intimately united with two main angels who are the Son and the holy spirit (Zechariah 4:3,11-14). Furthermore, the creator probably has seven main angels (Zechariah 4:2,10). 
60 God can use the most unexpected means to enable those He loves to have, possibly anonymous, an eternally useful inheritance that can continue to exist in an enhanced form (Isaiah 40:25-28 - Jeremiah 45 - Proverbs 16:7 - Exodus 13:17-18). 
61 It is not a sin to be strong or rich. But it is a sin to consider that these trumps can scare the lord of all the earth or that these trumps are a marvelous gift from him because it is not these things that can pass with certainty to future generations an eternally wonderful inheritance (Proverbs 18:11 - Psalms 49 - Habakkuk 1:6-12 - Zechariah 4:6). 
62 God is for equal opportunities everywhere and at all times, considering everyone only according to their real abilities without favoring the poor (Exodus 23:1-8) and without disfavoring the rich (Exodus 30:14-15). 
63 This does not mean that within any community any foreigner making a temporary stay must have exactly the same rights as a native in all aspects of social life. 
64 However if you have to evaluate different people on a particular parameter (students in a classroom may be of different nationalities and backgrounds, some not even having confirmed legal status yet and I am in charge of assessing their knowledge of history - there was a fight in the street because a person provoked another and I am responsible for identifying the culprit - a person is looking for an object that was stolen from him and I am in charge to understand and solve his problem). 
65 Then only the parameter concerned must be the object of the concern of the judge who must not worry about the other aspects of the life of the people involved (2 Chronicles 19:1-11 -Deuteronomy 1:16-17). 
66 Some atheist does not seek proof of the existence of any god because logic is sufficient to understand nature but in this statement no clear definition of the word 'god' is proposed: if I say that I believe in the God of logic, am I in contradiction with the atheist. 
67 False christians give the wrong meaning to the phrase 'believe in Jesus of Nazareth' because christianity teaches that Jesus is the king of the Jews (Luke 23:38 - John 19:19-22) therefore a christian must ask himself: What should a Jew who loves the King of the Jews do. 
68 The commandments of the Jewish Bible are not frozen in time because between the beginning of Genesis and the Levitical book of Moses there is an evolution of what is allowed to eat (Genesis 1:29 - 9:1-3 - Leviticus 11:1-4). 
69 And the events described in the last five chapters of the book of Judges occurred after the death of Joshua (Judges 17:6 - 18:1 - 19:1), and the populations have their habits (Exodus 20:3-4 - Deuteronomy 5:7-8 - Exodus 28:30 - Leviticus 8:5-8 - Deuteronomy 33:8-11 - Numbers 27:18-21 - Judges 17). But it is inconceivable that the tribe of Dan did not offer peace to their enemies [designated by Moses and Joshua] before attacking them (Judges 18:27-30 - Deuteronomy 20:10-12 - Joshua 11:18-20 - 1 Chronicles 4:38-43), for it must be thought that this was simply not mentioned. 
70 And also the commandments of Moses are not all kept even by those who really love God since the tabernacle, the dwelling place of Yahweh which was built by Moses, has been replaced through the initiative of king David by a stationary house (2 Samuel 7:1-3). And it is possible that it was not only the members of the tribe of Levi who taught the knowledge of the law of Moses to the people in the time of Jesus of Nazareth (Numbers 3:11-16,39-41,42-51 - Deuteronomy 10:5-9 - Nehemiah 8:6-12), since Jesus was from the tribe of Judah and he was not condemned because he taught in the synagogues of the people (Luke 4:14-16 - 7:1-5 - John 6:57-60 - 18:19-20) and in the temple of Yahweh (Luke 2:40-46 - 19:45-48 - 21:37-38 - John 8:19-20 - 10:22-24 - Deuteronomy 12:13-14) but only because of his particular message (Luke 4:20-28,29-30 - John 5:16-18 - 10:25-36). [Since the functions that had been assigned to the Levites in the past (Numbers 1:50-54 - 4:1-20,21-28,29-33) should no longer be valid even in theory after the movable tabernacle built by Moses will has been replaced by a fixed house, therefore David gave new functions to the Levites (1 Chronicles 16:1-7 - 23:27-32 - 2 Chronicles 29:25) and for this reason David asked to number the Levites who will carry out the service by designating them among those who are twenty years old and above (1 Chronicles 23:1-3,25-27). For during the days of Moses, when the Levites had just received the function of transporting the sanctuary of Yahweh, the plans of which were shown to Moses because this structure did not exist before (5 Rommel 9:14-17 - Exodus 25:9,40 - 26:30 - 39:42-43), the Levites were numbered from the age of one month to know their total (Numbers 3:14-16,39 - 26:57-62,63-65) or from the age of thirty to transport the tabernacle (Numbers 4:34-49), and they could serve in the different parts of the sanctuary from the age of twenty five (Numbers 8:22-26).] 
71 Whoever calls himself a religious Jew practicing Judaism after having read the writings on Jesus is really someone strange because he has deep down himself, in everything he does, the secret mission of identifying the twelve tribes of Israel distinctly. 
72 And if he is asked why he believes in the Hebrew Bible which he himself received without having witnessed its writing, and does not believe in Jesus of Nazareth who is also an available knowledge. 
73 Then on the one hand he can explain that there are inconsistencies in the christian New Testament. 
74 However there are also in the Hebrew Bible, and in the same way that there are also books which are not considered as being holy scriptures by the Jewish bible, in the same way he should be interested in separating the books of the new testament author by author in order to also identify possible falsifications. 
75 The apostle Paul teaches that God loves everyone from same way but that it is aimed primarily at non-Jews to teach them the knowledge of the faith. 
76 On the other hand he can ask us why we believe in Jesus without having witnessed these events ourselves, but we only know that there is a message worthy of being received and whoever does not accept this message is an enemy of humanity (Galatians 3:21-29 - 1 John 4:20-21).
77 A religious artistic presentation does not necessarily consist in alluding to the holy scripture because it is simply a question of exposing useful achievements for its development, likely to be imitated in an edifying way.
78 In other words it is a question of bearing witness to the power of the holy spirit (Zechariah 4:6). Thus the trick of the Devil consists in promoting behaviors that are either useless or destructive.
