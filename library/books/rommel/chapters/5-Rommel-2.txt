1 Overview.
2 Indeed, and it is necessary not to be wrong, it is not a man that we must believe to have eternal life.
3 But it is in the one who came down from the sky and who went back to sit down to the right of his father. 
4 There are deaths who have been resurrected according to the texts of the Gospels, but no resurrected one has ascended into heaven (John 7:18). 
5 This document should help to understand the gospel (John 3:13-21). 
6 The principle of the trinity (God the Father, and God the Son, and God the holy spirit), which I propose to call the first trinity, can be described as follows.
7 The creator, who is God the Father, is described in the Bible by rather special events that he has organized. 
8 Among others, he has announced by various authors the coming of his only begotten son in the world, the coming of God the Son (Genesis 49:10 - Psalms 2:7-12 - Isaiah 50:4-11). 
9 And since Jesus the man has risen from the dead to sit at the right of his father in heavenly places, men can receive God in their hearts in the form of the holy spirit who is called God the holy spirit (John 7:38-39 - 15:26 - Ephesians 2:22 - 1 Corinthians 3:16 - 1 John 4:6). 
10 I state the principle of the second trinity (Jesus the God, and Jesus the only begotten Son of God, and Jesus the man) as follows. 
11 The expression Jesus the God stems from the fact that it must be admitted that even if he spoke with great mischief, Jesus the man has never lied since his birth from a virgin woman until his installation on the right of his father (John 8:44,54-55 - Ephesians 4:21-24). 
12 And Jesus the only begotten Son of God is the Christ. More precisely it is the concept of love of the general interest, the explicit form of the unique command given by Jesus the man.
13 He came into the world in the form of Jesus the man, and he did not leave the world after the departure of Jesus the man (1 John 3:6 - John 14:6 - Ephesians 1:20-23).
14 The one who denies that everyone's objective must be to participate in the general interest, this one is certainly a liar (1 John 2:22-23). 
15 The set of all men of all nations who have the circumcised heart is the church. It is this set that is the body of the only begotten son of God (Ephesians 4:14-16 - 1 Corinthians 12:27 - 1 Peter 2:9-10 - Romans 12:4-5).
16 With the second trinity, on the one hand faith and the possible associated persecutions do not necessarily consist in taking an interest in Jesus the man but unquestionably in Christ. 
17 On the other hand, messianic prophecies become a little less obscure because we can see that some are written about Jesus the man (Isaiah 53). 
18 And some others are written about Jesus the only begotten Son of God whose body is the true church (Isaiah 42:1-9). 
19 And some others are written about both (Isaiah 52:13-15).
20 Faith consists only in loving God with all your heart and in loving your neighbor as yourself (Luke 10:25-28).  
21 More concretely, since God is simply the notion of truth in christianity as I will expose it in the section 'The identity of God', faith consists in loving everyone in general and not trusting anyone in particular (1 Timothy 5:24). 
22 I am writing this document because I would have liked someone to do it for me when I started to be interested in the content of the Bible in early March of 2014. Previously, it had already happened to me open a Bible, two or three times, to search methodically the interest of its contents. 
23 But I had always started with the first pages of the book, and I had always been discouraged after the first two chapters of Genesis because I did not understand what was God's pilosity, and his exact hairstyle, at the moment when he breathed a breath of life into the nostrils of the man he had created in his image. 
24 I had then convinced myself that this book could only be a collection of poems expressly conceived to comfort, under different circumstances, those who need to be comforted. 
25 Thus, before the end of 2013, I did not know what the terms old testament and new testament mean, nor the words gospel and apostle which had a comic connotation in my mind.  
26 I did not study the entire contents of the old testament to conceive of this work (John 6:43-46). 
27 On the subject of my willingness to share what I understood from my investigations, I must say that I never received an order or a promise like the apostle Paul. I am simply the work of God, as each of between us.
