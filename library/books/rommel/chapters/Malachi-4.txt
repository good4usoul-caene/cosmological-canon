1 For behold, the day is coming and it will burn like a furnace. All the proud and all those who act wickedly [among my people who are called by my name now] will be punished. The day that comes will burn them up, says Yahweh the God of armies, and it will leave them neither root nor branch. 
2 But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will arise with healing under its wings. And you will go out and leap like calves freed from their stalls. 
3 And you will trample the wicked. For they will be like ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I do this, says Yahweh the God of armies. [Now this must have happened after the first disciples of Jesus, in the period of the destruction of the house of Yahweh which has never rebuilt to this day. But this will not be the main occasion because even in those days an acceptable level of knowledge of the teaching of Jesus Christ will not yet be reached by the Romans who will destroy the temple of Yahweh because of a rebellion, as the rebellion of Zedekiah the last king of Judah had caused the destruction of the temple built by Solomon king of Israel.] 
4 Remember the law of my servant Moses, which I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel, concerning the statutes and the judgment. 
5 Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of Yahweh. 
6 And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the land with a curse.
