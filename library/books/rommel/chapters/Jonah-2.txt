1 And Jonah prayed to Yahweh his God with the following words while he was in the belly of the fish. [Jonah said these words when he realized that he was still alive.] 
2 I called on Yahweh in my distress, and he answered me. I cried out of the womb of hell, and you heard my voice. 
3 For you have cast me into the depth, into the heart of the seas, and the floods have surrounded me. All your waves and your billows have passed over me. 
4 Then I have said: I am driven out of your sight [that is to say, I will die and thus leave the world of the living]. Nevertheless I will look again at your holy temple [that is to say, I will not forget you and I will search for your dwelling place in the heaven]. 
5 The waters surrounded me closely and reached my soul. The depths were closing in on me, and the seaweeds were wrapped around my head. 
6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains, and the bars of the earth were enclosing me forever. But you have brought me up alive from the pit, O Yahweh my God. 
7 I remembered Yahweh when my soul was fainting within me, and my prayer came to you into your holy temple [in the heaven]. 
8 Those who cling to worthless things are forsaking their own mercy. 
9 As for me, the sacrifices that I will offer you are the thanksgiving of my voice, and I will fulfill my vows when I make them. Salvation comes from Yahweh. 
10 And Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah on the dry land.
