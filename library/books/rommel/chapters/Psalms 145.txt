1 A psalm of David. I will extol you, O my God and king. I will bless your name forever and ever. 
2 I will bless you daily, and I will sing praises to your name forever and ever. 
3 For Yahweh is great and deserves to be highly praised. His greatness is inscrutable. 
4 One generation will praise your works to another, and will declare your power. 
5 I will meditate on the beauty of your glorious majesty, and on your wondrous works. 
6 I will declare your greatness, and they will speak of the power of your scary acts.
7 They will spread the remembrance of your great goodness, and sing of your righteousness. 
8 Yahweh is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and full of love. 
9 Yahweh is good to everyone, and his mercies are over all his works. 
10 All your works will praise you, O Yahweh, and your saints will bless you. 
11 They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, and proclaim your power. 
12 To make known to the sons of men your power and the glorious splendor of your kingdom. 
13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures throughout all generations. 
14 Yahweh upholds his beloved ones who are in trouble, he rises those who have fallen. 
15 The eyes of all creatures wait for you, and you give them their food at the appropriate time. 
16 You open your hand, and satisfy every living thing according to your good pleasure. 
17 Yahweh is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. 
18 Yahweh is near to all those who call on him, to all those who call on him with sincerity. 
19 He fulfills the desire of those who really fear him, for he hears their cry and preserves them. [The desires of such persons are in accordance with his will.] 
20 Yahweh preserves each of those who love him, and he will destroy all the wicked. 
21 My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh. Let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
