1 A psalm of Asaph [concerning the glory of the temple of Yahweh at a time when the hearts of the people are not far from his commandments]. God is known in Judah, his name is great in Israel. 
2 There is peace in his tabernacle, his dwelling place is in Zion. 
3 There he has broken the arrows of the bow, and the shield, and the sword, and other weapons of war. Pause. 
4 You are more majestic and more glorious than the mountains of prey. 
5 They have been stripped, these brave heroes. They have slept their last sleep. They did not know how to defend themselves, all these valiant men. 
6 Both horsemen and horses have slept [have died] at your rebuke, O God of Jacob. 
7 You are to be feared, you. Who can resist you when your anger is kindled.
8 You have made judgment heard from heaven, and the earth was afraid and kept silent. 
9 God will arise to do justice, to save all powerless of the earth. Pause. 
10 Surely the anger of man enables you to accomplish your purposes. The consequences of this anger are a garment for you.
11 Fulfill the vows you make voluntarily to God. Let all those who are around him [his temple] bring gifts to the one who is worthy of being feared. 
12 He brings down the pride of princes. He is feared by the kings of the earth.
