1 A psalm of David. Yahweh has said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool. 
2 Yahweh will extend the scepter of your power from Zion. Be the ruler in the midst of your enemies. 
3 Your people are full of zeal when you gather your army. In the beauties of holiness, the young persons of your army come to you like dew that comes from the womb of the morning. 
4 Yahweh has sworn, and he will not repent: You are a priest forever, after the manner of Melchizedek. 
5 The Lord is at your right hand, and he will shatter kings in the day of his wrath. 
6 He performs justice among the nations, he fills the places with dead bodies. He crushes the heads of arrogant people throughout the world. 
7 He drinks from the brook in the way, therefore he lifts up his head.
