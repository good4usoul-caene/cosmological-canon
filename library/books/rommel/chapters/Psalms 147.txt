1 Praise Yahweh. For it is good to sing praises to our God, for it is pleasant and fitting to praise him. 
2 Yahweh rebuilds Jerusalem, and he gathers together the outcasts of Israel. 
3 He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. 
4 He counts the number of the stars, and knows each of them by name. 
5 Our Lord is great and powerful. His wisdom is infinite. 
6 Yahweh sustains the powerless, and he brings the wicked down to the ground. 
7 Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving. Sing praises to our God with the harp. 
8 He covers the heaven with clouds, and prepares rain for the earth. He makes grass grow on the mountains. 
9 He gives food to the cattle, and to the young ravens when they cry. 
10 He does not delight in the strength of the horse, he does not delight in the legs of man. 
11 For Yahweh takes pleasure only in those who fear him and who hope in his mercy. 
12 Praise Yahweh, O Jerusalem. Praise your God, O Zion. 
13 For he makes the bars of your gates, and he blesses your children in the midst of you. 
14 He makes peace in your borders, and he satisfies you with the finest of the wheat. 
15 He sends his commandment on earth, and his word runs very swiftly. 
16 He gives snow like wool. He scatters hoarfrost like ashes.
17 He casts his hail like stones. And who can stand before his cold. 
18 And he sends his word, and he causes his wind to blow. And the ice melts, and the waters flow. 
19 He revealed his word to Jacob. He gave his statutes and his judgments to Israel. 
20 He has not done it with the other nations, he has not given them his judgments. Praise Yahweh.
