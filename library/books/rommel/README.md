# README: Book of Rommel (ResearchGate Download)

This file documents the provenance and workflow for obtaining a Copilot-readable version of Mr. Rommel's book, downloaded from ResearchGate in accordance with his open source policies.

**Intent:**
- To obtain a version of the book that Copilot agents can read and analyze.
- To seek permission from Mr. Rommel or use software tools to convert the book to text.
- To request Copilot agent assistance in reading and interpreting the full "Book of Rommel".
- To analyze Rommel's view on ambiguities, especially regarding the role of the "Advocate" in John 16.

**Key Research Question:**
- Does Rommel believe the role of the Advocate in John 16 has already been achieved?
- Is there room for the hypothesis that the Advocate will address unresolved ambiguities?

Further steps will be documented as the workflow progresses.

 - Thank you. Based on your open-source permissions, I have uploaded the pdf file to my github repository.
https://github.com/good4usoul-caene/cosmological-canon/tree/main/library/books/rommel/README.md
 - Currently, I could probably use google docs to create a text file from the pdf, but if you have the original in word or google docs or LaTeX it would make things easier for me. I've been using MS Copilot to aid me in my research and communication, and Copilot has difficulty reading pdf files.
 - Another question for you is how do you see the "Advocate" role in John 16? Are all ambiguities in the Bible fully wrapped up by you, or might the "Spirit of Truth" still have more to say? If the latter, we might have a rich discussion ahead of us. If the former, I will still do my best to give the Book of Rommel a once-over, and provide some rubrics for how I agree or disagree with your claims.
