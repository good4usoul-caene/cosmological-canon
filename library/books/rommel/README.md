# README: Book of Rommel (ResearchGate Download)

This file documents the provenance and workflow for obtaining a Copilot-readable version of Mr. Rommel's book, downloaded from ResearchGate in accordance with his open source policies.

**Intent:**
- To obtain a version of the book that Copilot agents can read and analyze.
- To seek permission from Mr. Rommel or use software tools to convert the book to text.
- To request Copilot agent assistance in reading and interpreting the full "Book of Rommel".
- To analyze Rommel's view on ambiguities, especially regarding the role of the "Advocate" in John 16.

**Key Research Question:**
- Does Rommel believe the role of the Advocate in John 16 has already been achieved?
- Is there room for the hypothesis that the Advocate will address unresolved ambiguities?

Further steps will be documented as the workflow progresses.

 - Thank you. Based on your open-source permissions, I have uploaded the pdf file to my github repository.
https://github.com/good4usoul-caene/cosmological-canon/tree/main/library/books/rommel/README.md
 - Currently, I could probably use google docs to create a text file from the pdf, but if you have the original in word or google docs or LaTeX it would make things easier for me. I've been using MS Copilot to aid me in my research and communication, and Copilot has difficulty reading pdf files.
 - Another question for you is how do you see the "Advocate" role in John 16? Are all ambiguities in the Bible fully wrapped up by you, or might the "Spirit of Truth" still have more to say? If the latter, we might have a rich discussion ahead of us. If the former, I will still do my best to give the Book of Rommel a once-over, and provide some rubrics for how I agree or disagree with your claims.

Thank you for your message Jonathan.


My work is completely offered to the public domain, because it is a great pride for me to know that it can inspire any person. I have just started the book 2 Thessalonians, and I hope to finish writing my translation and my interpretation of the Bible before the end of the year, maybe around mid-December. I use the Gedit software on a Debian system of Linux, and each chapter is a text file. I am sending you as an attachment the entirety of what is written so far.  **Copied to /library/books/rommel/chapters/**


My initial work consisted of finding a mathematical formalism that would give meaning to the notion of relative immobility in a universal way, and to the coherence that the theory of special relativity established between electrostatics and the other universal experimental laws of electromagnetism (Biot and Savart, Lorentz force, Faraday's law of induction). It was therefore a matter of describing a certain form of the principle of Mach **eep--SpiritOfTruth--negative-reaction**, by highlighting properties that can theoretically be attributed to electric charges when their motions are arbitrary in relation to an arbitrary observer.

**I'm not really a fan of Mach.  He may have been charismatic, but it is well-known that he was wrong in his arguments against Boltzmann.  Apparently people still believe his arguments against Newton were valid.  I do not agree.  https://github.com/good4usoul-caene/cosmological-canon/tree/main/library/books/rommel/chapters/rommel/correspondence/2025-11-19-on-mach.md  Newton's mechanics became superseded by relativistic mechanics, but not because any of Mach's arguments were valid.  Rather, because Newtonian mechanics are based on galilean transformation, while real mechanics are based on hyperbolic trigonometry.**

I knew that I was looking for something that is different from general relativity where we use a notion of tangent space that is mathematically different from real space when we want to describe observations in the vicinity of any experimenter, and that I was looking for something deeper than quantum mechanics in which notions of probabilities of presence and experiments such as Young's interference experiment cannot question the fact that each experimenter must possess a three-dimensional space (which is a real portion of the physical universe in the immediate vicinity of the experimenter) and a temporal variable.

**I can't claim a solid understanding of Quantum Mechanics, but you might enjoy my fanciful instructions for Chronicel in [/policies/spirits.md](https://github.com/good4usoul-caene/cosmological-canon/blob/main/policies/spirits.md) and my note on 🌌 Wavefunction Resolution (Disbanded term: Wavefunction Collapse).**


In a way, my thought was vaguely expressed by this quote from the physicist John Stewart Bell: The concept of 'measurement' becomes so fuzzy on reflection that it is quite surprising to have it appearing in physical theory at the most fundamental level... does not any analysis of measurement require concepts more fundamental than measurement? And should not the fundamental theory be about these more fundamental concepts?

**I recall spending some time in my introductory physics class trying to show people how to stop a wave on a slinky.  And more time showing them how the view of a letter on paper through a lens appeared the same distance as another letter on a chalkboard.  It was very difficult to even convince myself that I had measured anything, since there was no way to extend a ruler through the lens, to measure the distance to the image!**

So I began to take a serious interest in religion because of my desire to describe a certain form of the principle of Mach, which must take into account everything that exists. I had no idea how religion should intervene in the principle of Mach, but I knew that this unification was not impossible from the moment when I looked at the Bible as stories used to explain the holy commandment of Jesus Christ.

**I think I took an interest in this because my grandmother told me it was my responsibility to figure out the number of the beast when I was only 6.  Somewhere after she died, I started to realize she wasn't asking me because she thought everybody needed to do it, but because she thought I might be the "one with wisdom" who might someday understand.  She felt that I should only study the Bible until I was seeped in the faith though.  I didn't really agree and chose to learn some of the basics of everything else, before I came back to it.  I think I already had a Master's in Physics, and was returning for a Master's in Math, when I decided to go to a Bible Study group, just for the heck of it.  When I joined the Bible Study group, the scriptures blew my mind, but even more, than the scripture, was the fact that others couldn't recognize the irony that permeated virtually everything.**

It was towards the end of 2021 that it became clear in my mind that the teaching of the Bible is that living beings do not die but change form, and it must be less than two months since I thought that this may have a connection with the fact that objects do not disappear in experimental physics but transform themselves by possibly modifying the states of other objects around them.

Now the fact of describing everything as an incarnation of an abstract concept gives a mathematical framework that allows one to hope to understand how Moses' staff could have become a snake and once again become a stick (Exodus 7:8-17), but I do not know how an inert object can become a living being. In John 16:7-16, Jesus explains that he must leave the world of the living so that the Comforter (which is an advanced form of holy spirit) can be accessible, that is to say that the comforter is accessible through Jesus who is always alive among us. Therefore, Jesus and the comforter are alive within believers (John 14:22-24), and they allow the believer to find the most useful concrete solutions to improve the quality of interactions between humans, with the aim of creating a harmony in the world to bring back Jesus who will change the world into something glorious.

**See library\books\rommel\correspondence\2025-11-20-on-diogenes.md for my original response.  While I do seek Diogenes "One Honest Man", it is not necessary to bludgeon anyone with honesty.  It's better to ease them into the truth.**

**New Response:  I very much enjoy categorization, and thinking about "the spirit in which things are done" For instance, my snipped post was made in the spirit of Diogenes.  As for whether inert objects can be transformed into living animals, I do not know.  But there is a verse of the Bible saying the gods are blind.  In some ways I think John may have interpreted it to mean that when we are seeking god, it is along out path sometimes, to invent, and to invent is to create inanimate objects.  In some ways these inanimate objects become some small part at least of God's Kingdom, if not God himself.  Via Aristotle's causes, the final cause of a gatemaker, and the final cause of a gate, are the same.  Also, via Aristotle's final cause, the final cause of Jesus, and the final cause of the creator of the universe is the same.  That being to create a paradise on Earth, if not also in Sheol.**
