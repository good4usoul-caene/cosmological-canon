Change-Note: Draft README for /tent/ (local copy)
RitualNote: Tent holds tentative drafts created at the user's request. Do not auto-create tent content without explicit user instruction.
Space: tent
Promotion-Ready: tent-draft
---

Purpose
The /tent/ directory is for tentatively composed drafts—partial policies, early canonical text, or intermediate artifacts that are explicitly created at the user's request. Tent files are closer to canonical form than pasture/cache drafts but still require Owner confirmation prior to promotion.

Principles
- Keep the /tent/ repository directory PERFECTLY CLEAN except for THIS README.md file.
- Files in /tent/ should be created or modified only with explicit user instruction.
- Each tent file must include front matter describing the proposed Ultimate-Target-Directory and a clear Change-Note.
- Promotion from /tent/ to canonical locations (/policies/, /methods/, etc.) requires SEARCH‑AND‑INSERT, Owner confirmation, and passing validation checks.

Promotion path (echo → repository)
- Promotion path is: /pasture/ <-> (tent or cache optional) -> Ultimate-Target-Directory (echo-space) -> Ultimate-Target-Directory (repository space)
- Promotion path is: /cache/ <-> (tent or pasture optional) -> Ultimate-Target-Directory (echo-space) -> Ultimate-Target-Directory (repository space)

Process
- To promote a tent artifact:
  1. Add or verify front matter (include UTD and a RitualNote).
  2. Run SEARCH‑AND‑INSERT and confirm the selected insertion location.
  3. Set Promotion-Ready: owner-approved only after Owner review.
  4. Open a PR and request the required CODEOWNERS reviewers.
