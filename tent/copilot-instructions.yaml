# Copilot Agent Instructions (Staged YAML)

This file is a YAML-formatted staging copy of copilot-instructions.md. It retains only the required headers (`description`, `applyTo`) as supported for instructions/configuration files.

## Notes:
- Only `description` and `applyTo` are valid headers for instructions/configuration files.
- Full Markdown formatting and universal-template fields are not supported in `.yaml` instructions files for Copilot agent configuration.
- Use `.md` for documentation and `.instructions` for agent directives.

## Next Steps:
- Review and revise the content below as plain text or simple lists.
- If you need rich formatting or full front-matter, use a Markdown file instead.
