# The Queen of the South - Content Manifest

**Document Type**: Word Document Analysis  
**Subject**: Biblical narrative and theological commentary  
**Focus**: The Queen of the South (Queen of Sheba) in biblical texts  

## Content Description
This Word document contains light-hearted eschatological analysis structured as a trial proceeding, where angels weigh scriptural evidence to build a case regarding the Pisces age. The work emerged during a hypomanic creative period and remains unfinished. The trial framework serves as an interpretive heuristic for discovering hidden meanings in scripture, making bold hermeneutical claims about prophetic timelines and divine judgment.

A great task was undertaken within this document to consolidate the gospels.  Matthew in boldface, Mark underlined, Luke in italics,  John in red.  Author invoked the meaning of "Doolin" "Dubhflahnn" meaning Black/Red as extra prophetic influence that the red was needed.  

A "miracle" was observed by the author when his faith grew from the size of mustard seeds to the size of hard candies.

Establishment of "metaphoriel" as the angel of Euphamism in the story, became a constant companion for the author.  Leading to some awkward moments, and eventual bipolar medication prescription for aziprapole, which ended any inappropriate behaviors, but also cut off any feelings of joy or usefulness, and ended progress on this work.  After a few months, it was agreed by advocate's doctor and parents to end that particular prescription.

## Theological Significance
This unfinished work represents creative exploration during elevated mood states, where the sense of cosmic significance felt authentic and urgent. Subsequent medical intervention (aziprapole) affected both the perceived importance of the work and the author's sense of life significance. The trial format offers innovative approach to eschatological interpretation, though its incompletion reflects the intersection of creativity, mental health, and pharmaceutical intervention in spiritual work.
