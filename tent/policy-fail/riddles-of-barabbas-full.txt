# The Riddles of Barabbas
**A Rhyming Commentary on John's Gospel**

By Jonathan Doolin  
December 17, 2021

---

## Preface

This work presents John's Gospel translated line-by-line into rhyming verse with extensive commentary and interpretation. The central thesis proposes that each chapter of John's Gospel functions as a riddle, with Jesus Barabbas ("Son of the Father") as a distinct character from Jesus of Nazareth.

The rhyming constraint serves both as a creative framework and as a therapeutic tool for managing bipolar disorder, providing structure and focus during periods of intense theological reflection.

## Full Text

Tab 1 The riddles of Barabbas Jonathan Doolin December 17, 2021 We'd better get cracking if names are your thing. You're told to believe in them, it would be sane to learn what they mean, in Hebrew or Greek. Find out if a teacher or clown you do seek.) My approach handling John's gospel's core discrepancy, is note the differences when apt, and stress this remedy: to guess two men are in these tales with so much variation. It's irresponsible for us to fail delineation. So I'd suggest two names for whether shorthand or a fact, so Jesus "Son of Father", "Son of Man" can interact. "Son of Father" In Hebrew, translates to just "Barabbas" depending on the rhyme I need, I'll say "J. Bar", "J. Bas" the other Jesus, he's a man, with body made of flesh. so if I want to speak of him, I'll say "j. lamb", "J. Beth." Barabbas spoke in riddles, which BethLaham was the rhyme for Bethlehem meant house of bread or meat, back in that time. No matter what the things we say; the truth or sophistry Words are what we use to tell the tale of history 1 The Riddles of Barabbas 1 The Parable of Language Several interpretations present themselves for John 1 because of many ambiguities. As John describes John, is he, in every sentence, referring to John the Baptist, or is he sometimes referring to himself? Why is the "Before me... After me" phrase repeated twice? (John 1:15, 30) Why is the Lamb of God introduced twice? (John 1:29, 36). Why is only one of the two men following Jesus identified? (John 1:40) Why does Jesus use a Greek translation for "Rock" for Peter's name here, instead of just calling him "Peter" as he does in the other gospels? (John 1:42) What did they see when the saw where Jesus was staying and what is the significance of four in the afternoon? (John 1:39) Why was Nathanael so impressed when Jesus said he saw him under the fig tree? (John 1:48-49) What are the implications of Nathanael's question, "Can anything good from Nazareth?" considering that Jesus says "in him there is no deceit"? What does it mean to see"Angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man"?
