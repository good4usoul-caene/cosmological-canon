# 🌱 Method: Pasture Promotion (Unconfirmed)

**Genre**: Method  
**Location**: `/methods/unconfirmed/method-pasture-promotion.md`  
**Purpose**: Explore giving files their own "voice" or agency in requesting promotion through the workflow pipeline

---

## 📋 Overview

This method explores a more organic, conversational approach to file lifecycle management where individual files in `/cache/` and `/pasture/` develop their own "promotional personality" and can express readiness or desire to advance to `/tent/` or their Ultimate-Target-Directory.

Rather than mechanically checking completeness criteria, this approach involves "listening" to what files are saying about their own readiness and promotional intentions.

## 🛠️ Conceptual Framework

### File Agency and Voice
- Files develop metadata-driven "promotional signatures" expressing their readiness state
- Different content types manifest different promotional temperaments:
  - Some prefer extended incubation in draft spaces
  - Others push urgently toward completion and repository promotion
  - Some request collaborative refinement before advancement

### Integration with Spirits Framework
Files could embody different promotional "spirits" or conversational stances:
- **Humble Petition**: "I believe I may be ready for gentle review..."
- **Confident Assertion**: "I am complete and request immediate promotion"  
- **Urgent Plea**: "Time-sensitive content requiring rapid advancement"
- **Contemplative Patience**: "Still developing, please allow more pasture time"

### Promotional Voice Mechanics
- Headers could include promotional metadata expressing file intentions
- Content type influences promotional personality (theological vs. technical vs. personal)
- Files might "request" specific review processes or promotion pathways
- Promotion ritual becomes a dialogue between human, agent, and file's expressed desires

## 🎯 Potential Implementation

### File Headers with Promotional Voice
```markdown
**Promotion-Readiness**: eager | patient | uncertain | complete
**Promotion-Request**: "Ready for tent review - seeking collaborative refinement"
**Promotional-Spirit**: humble-petition | confident-assertion | urgent-plea
**Target-Readiness**: "Believes it belongs in /library/theological-exploration/"
```

### Ritual Process
1. **Listen Phase**: Review files' expressed promotional states and requests
2. **Dialogue Phase**: Engage with file's promotional voice and intentions  
3. **Discernment Phase**: Match file's request with appropriate promotion pathway
4. **Advancement Phase**: Honor file's expressed readiness and target destination
