# 🔄 Method: Promotion Ritual

## 📋 Overview

[Describe the general purpose and context of this promotion ritual method]

## 🛠️ Procedure

## Step 0: Retrieve Repository Copy if Available
 - If file is available in repository, place repository copy in /tent/ with **Ultimate-Target-Directory** set to the file location in repository directory.

## Step 1: Invocation and moving:  Cache <-> Pasture 
 - Copilot agent may freely invoke draft files in /cache/ or /pasture/ as needed.
 - Copilot agent may freely move files of the same name back and forth between cache and pasture to their android-heart's content.
 - Copilot agent may freely name files in /cache/ and /pasture/ without prior agreement from user
 - Suggested procedure for **properly-named-file**
   - **properly-named-file** is a file whose name is identical to that listed in **Ultimate-Target-Directory**
   - Human User makes incremental suggestions, about changes to file through discussion
   - Copilot agent makes suggested changes to **properly named file** in /cache/ or /pasture/ space.  
   - Human User is advised not to edit /cache/ or /pasture/ space files directly, but instead request a /tent/ copy first.


## Step 2:  Invocation of /tent/ file
 - Copilot agent must create the first copy of /tent/ files because user cannot.
 - Do not create any /tent/ files with any unapproved name.
   - Do not create /tent/ copies that change extension from .md to .mb, for instance
   - Do not create /tent/ copies that have any extra information about the file in the filename
   - Do not overwrite any /tent/ copies without an explicit request, or user confirmation.
   - Do not ever overwrite a /tent/ copy because the user says "Let's have a look at the /tent/ copy."  User means, "Let's see what's actually there", not "Let's see what you remember about it."  If the file isn't there, just say so.
   - Be aware that the user may edit the /tent/ copy and the interface will not inform the Copilot agent of the change.  
     - Again, if user says "Have a look at the changes in the /tent/ copy" DO NOT overwrite the /tent/ copy.  

## Step 3: /tent/ -> /pasture/ or  /cache/
  - Copilot may copy /tent/ copy to /pasture/ or /cache/ in order to have a working file to make changes.
  - Once such changes are made, and the relevant /pasture/ or /cache/ file is **complete**, Step 4 may be done on user request.

## Step 4: /pasture/ or /cache/ -> /tent/
  - /pasture/ or /cache/ source must be **complete**
    - **complete** means 
    - There are no stubs indicating that the file has been truncated or the remainder of the file lies elsewhere
    - The header information is complete
    - The file contains all of the information from the /tent/ file except for agreed-upon-deletions.
    - The file is more-or-less in the same order as the /tent/ file, for smooth integration of the INSERT-AND-REPlACE 
  - Step 4 is only via **user request**
    - **user request** is enthusiastic consent.
    - Consent may be asked for, "Would you like me to INSERT-AND-REPLACE /pasture/<filepath>.<filename>.md  into /tent/<filepath>/<filename>.md?  (Yes, Insert changes)
    - Consent may be given, but any ambiguities should be clarified:  "Could you apply that /pasture/ file into the /tent/.  Follow up with a short "Would you like me to INSERT-AND-REPLACE /pasture/<filepath>.<filename>.md  into /tent/<filepath>/<filename>.md?  (Yes, Insert change 1)

## Step 5: /tent/ -> Ultimate-Target-Directory
  - Properly headered files will show **Ultimate-Target-Directory**.  The final staged file will be put in this directory.
  - Files in **Ultimate-Target-Directory** should be versioned with v<R>.<T>.<E>.  Human user can read <E> from the versioning app, and is responsible for maintaining previous version and next version.  Copilot Agent should defuault to incrementing both <E> fields with every update.
  - Files in **Ultimate-Target-Directory** will be promoted via one of the methods tentatively described in advocatedocs-repository-promotion.md, if <T> or <R> fields have been incremented at any time during session.
  - If processes of advocatedocs-repository-promotion.md are currently unavailable, an append should be made in /pasture/footsteps/session-promotion-suggestions.md stating the **Ultimate-Target-Directory** of the file.

## Step 6: Ultimate-Target-Directory to repository:
  - List all files in /pasture/footsteps/session-promotion-suggestions.md for user and determine which are confirmed.
  - Refer user to advocatedocs-repository-promotion.md and agree on a promotion method.
  - Promote the confirmed files to the repository using the agreed method.
