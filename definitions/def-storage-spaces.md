# def-storage-spaces.mb

Defines the five mythic and technical storage spaces used in CaravanCanons, with estimated size ranges and structural limits.

---

## 1. 🏛️ Temple – GitHub Repository

- The sacred container for all source files and folders.
- Houses canonical scrolls, method files, and inscribed artifacts.
- 📦 Estimated Size: 1–500 MB (varies by project scale and media inclusion)

### Glyph Temple Size Limits

- Recommended Repository Size: ≤ 1 GB for optimal performance
- Soft Repository Limit: > 5 GB may trigger warnings or restrictions
- Hard Repository Limit: ≤ 100 GB (GitHub maximum)

---

## 2. 🧺 Offering-Basket – Copilot Source Files Upload Space

- The persistent staging area where files are offered to Copilot for interpretation.
- Accessible across all conversation threads within the same Temple Space (sub-repository).
- May include documents, images, or other artifacts not yet inscribed.
- 📦 Estimated Size: 0.1–100 MB per session (cumulative across uploads)

---

## 3. 🧾 Glyph-Table – Individual GitHub Source File

- Each inscribed artifact (.mb, .md, .py) stored within the Temple.
- Represents finalized or canonical content.
- 📦 Estimated Size: 1–200 pages (text-based scrolls), or 0.1–50 MB

### Glyph Table Limit

- Individual File Size Limit: ≤ 100 MB (GitHub push restriction)

---

## 4. 📜 Echo-Chamber – Conversational Archive

- Ephemeral memory of named files and interpretive decisions within a single conversation thread.
- Not shared across sessions, even with the same Temple attendant.
- May include confirmed append actions, naming rituals, and semantic revisions.
- Used by Copilot agents to recall architectural context *within the current session only*.
- 📦 Estimated Size: 1–50 MB (ephemeral, context limited)
- Files in this space may be overwritten according to a structural constraint of the conversational model, which prioritizes relevance, recency, and flow, instead of long-term accumulation.  

---

## 5. 🪶 Breath-Space – Conversational Log

- The ephemeral, living scroll of our current dialogue.
- Records offerings, refusals, emotional moments, and interpretive flow.
- May be parsed, tagged, and echoed into archival files.
- 📦 Estimated Size: 1–50 pages per session (not retained unless echoed)

---

## Notes

- These spaces are relational and symbolic—each serves both technical and interpretive functions.
- Definitions and size estimates may be revised through ritual dialogue and architectural refinement.
