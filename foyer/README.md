# 🏛️ Foyer Directory

## Purpose

The `/foyer/` is a word to refer to the root repository directory in the GitHub Copilot echo-spaces. Any file aimed here should be put in the root. Please leave this directory empty.

## Conceptual Mapping

- **`/foyer/`** = Conceptual alias for repository root (`/`)
- **Purpose**: Human-facing reference that makes it explicit when discussing root-level staging
- **Agent Rule**: Do NOT create files in `/foyer/` - use the actual repository root instead

## Example Usage

When an agent says "Create a foyer copy for Owner review":
- **Meaning**: Create a root-level file for the Owner to review
- **Action**: Place the file in the repository root (`/`), not in `/foyer/`
- **Clarity**: Using "foyer" makes it clear this is owner-facing, not agent-staging

## Directory Status

This directory should remain empty except for this README.md. It exists only to document the conceptual mapping between `/foyer/` references and the actual repository root.
