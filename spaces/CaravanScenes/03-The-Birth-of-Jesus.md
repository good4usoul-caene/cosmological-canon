📜 Chapter 3: Nazareth
And Odys, the Vintner, came to Nazareth, where the fields were golden with harvest. He carried his oar‑staff upon his shoulder, for the Caravan of the Fifth Wind had brought him inland.

Mary, young and bright, was winnowing wheat in the field. She saw Odys and said, “Sir, may I please try out that winnowing fan? It looks like a design I have never tried before.”

Odys gave her the oar‑staff. She lifted it, tested it, and said, “Well, this winnowing fan is no good at all. It pushes both the wheat and the chaff forward, without prejudice. Thank you, sir, but this will not do.”

Odys remembered the words of Tiresias in the Odyssey: “Carry the oar inland until someone mistakes the oar for a winnowing fan, and there build a temple to Poseidon.”

And Odys marveled, for the prophecy was fulfilled before his eyes. This young girl had mistaken the oar for a winnowing fan, so his was the task to dedicate a temple to Poseidon. But her task might be even greater yet, still. 

That night he rejoined the Caravan as Belzar lifted his hands and said, “In the 21st year of the reign of Augustus while Herod is king, On this the Fifth of Kislev, behold—the great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in Pisces! Any child conceived beneath this sign may fulfill prophecy, and salvation may come to the world.” 

There were some women that volunteered to have their fortunes read by Belzar, and to come up to consider whether they ought to conceive a child under this sign. One woman came up to say that she was barren, but she'd still like to try any miracle cures they had to offer. Durvasani looked her over, and found there was nothing she could do. Except... She pulled the mysterious scroll from her purse. "This is called Kunti's Mantra. If you read it and invoke the God you most desire, it invites him to implant you with a child." The woman read the scroll aloud, and finally said, "I don't think it is working. I really don't believe in *any* gods." Meanwhile, outside, Mary listened, and hearing Kunti's Mantra, she said, "But I believe in God."

When the Caravan of the Fifth wind left Nazareth, it was with joy and disappointment, as Belzar had really hoped to find out who would be conceived under the sign.  But no woman or man came forward.  

So they set off, again, in and around the towns of the Jews and the Greeks, bringing mirth, good taste, and healing to all.  

But soon it came apparent that a man, Quirinius who had served on the Greek consul since the 16th year of Augustus Caesar, was having a census in Bethlehem, the Town of David, for everyone in the territory.  Since such a census would make birth-dates a matter of public record, it would be their opportunity to discover, perhaps, if a child had been born under the third conjuntion; the conjunction that took Jupiter straight on into Aquarius.  

So the Caravan added to the crowd at Bethlehem.  They found themselves playing second fiddle to a greater phenomenon.  Shepherds were coming from the fields all around, reporting of angels.  Hustling and bustling to see a child lying in a manger.

Two of these shepherds met the caravan on their way into town.  They said to Odys, "The messiah has been born, glory to God."

"Where is he?" asked Odys?

"He's laying with his mother and foster-father in a manger.  You can't miss it.  They're surrounded by a large crowd."

And so Odys, Belzar, and Durvasini approached the crowd, and eventually made their way into the stable.  Mary was the first to recognize them.  "Durvasini!" she cried out.  

Odys said "Mary?"

Belzar said, "Now who is this?"

Odys said, "This is the young lady I was telling you about.  The one who mistook my oar for a winnowing fan!"

Durvasini looked upon the baby.  "Dear girl, did you have this child?"

Mary said, "Yes, Durvasini.  I heard your mantra read aloud, and Father in Heaven granted me a child."

And her husband Joseph said, "I've had some doubts, and done a lot of soul-searching, but now I'm convinced that everything will work out alright.  I love Mary, and I love this child, and accept him as the child of God."

Durvasini said, "Wonderful.  Well, let me give you something, both to honor your wedding, and to honor the birth of your first child.  It's all I have with me, right now.  A bit of gold, and tinctures of Frankinsense, and Myrrh.  These are tools of healing, and relief of pain.  I pray your child does both."

Joseph said "Well, perhaps he'll go into doctoring, but if he follows in his father's footsteps, he'll be a carpenter."

Odys steps forward, "Then have one piece of wood to start him on his way toward building a great temple.  I present the oar of Tiresias.  Or as your wife sees it, an incredibly ineffective winnowing fan."

Joseph said, "Tiresias.  Wasn't he a prophet of Roman gods?"

Odys said, "It is my hope that the temple the Messiah builds will have room for the chaff, for the gentiles, and for the Romans.  A temple with many rooms, and even one, perhaps, devoted to Poseidon.  In this way the Lord of Hosts may host many."

Joseph took the oar‑shaped staff.

Belzar said, “I am but a humble astrologer, with few gifts to give, save a vague understanding of the stars.” He bent down and scooped a handful of sand. “And perhaps there is no more meaning here than in this sand. Yet I can say: your child was born beneath a portentous sign—a triple conjunction in Pisces, at the dawn of the Age of Pisces. One day, I hope your child will acknowledge Pisces in a way future thinkers cannot deny, for the era of Pisces endures two thousand one hundred and sixty years.”

Mary asked, “What happens in the era of Pisces?”

Belzar replied, “In this era, Aphrodite escapes from Typhon upon the backs of two fish. And so salvation rides upon the waters, fleeing chaos, bearing love.”

A few days later, they brought the child to Jerusalem for circumcision. And Simeon Iscariot took the child in his arms and blessed him. He marked the flesh of Jesus of Nazareth.

The eighty‑four‑year‑old prophet Anna laughed happily, waking Simeon’s grandson Judas, who was bundled in swaddling cloth in her arms. “Imagine that, Simeon. You have tasted the flesh and blood of the Messiah. Asher’s food is rich, delicacies fit for a king. Perhaps this one,” she lifted young Judas, “will do the same for the Son of Man.”

Simeon took Jesus of Nazareth into his arms and prayed, (Luke 2:29–32, NIV) "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace, for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations; a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel."

The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.  But Simeon put Jesus back into Mary's arms and took up Judas, sighing, "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that is spoken against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed, and a sword will pierce your own soul, too."

At that very moment, Anna spoke again, saying, “Grace has come, for I have seen the face of God in these children. Simeon, you have held salvation, and now you hold the sign of contradiction. Asher’s blessing is upon them both: rich food, delicacies fit for a king. One will be spoken against, and one will be called betrayer, yet both will reveal the thoughts of many hearts. And when the sword pierces, it will pierce not only Mary’s soul, but the soul of Israel, until the last day of Pisces generation.”

(Luke 2:34–35; NIV) When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.
