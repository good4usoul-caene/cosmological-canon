In the parched hills of Ein Karem, where olive trees twisted in silence and the wind carried dust more often than rain, there lived a woman named Elizabeth. The children said she gathered water from dew, that her clay jugs filled themselves as she walked the dawn. But the truth, whispered only among the oldest shepherds, was more intricate—and more enduring.

They called her the Dew Woman—not because she gathered dew, but because her water was as rare and precious as dew in the desert.

Over decades, she had placed pots and jugs of every size and shape beneath the slow-dripping springs hidden in the folds of the hills. Some were tucked into crevices shaded by fig trees, others buried halfway in sand to keep them cool. She had shaped each vessel herself—wide-mouthed for the generous drips, narrow-necked for the stingy ones, glazed to resist the heat, unglazed to breathe.

Each morning, before the sun crested the ridge, Elizabeth walked alone with her clay jugs—hand-fired, thick-walled to keep the heat out. She knew the land like scripture: every shaded crevice, every limestone fold where water lingered in secret. These weren’t springs in the usual sense. They were slow drips—seepage from ancient aquifers, trickling from rock faces only in the cool hours before dawn.

She did not wait for them to fill. She walked a circuit, silent and steady, visiting each cache like a beekeeper tending hives. At each stop, she poured the gathered water into one of her six traveling jugs, then left the vessel to refill in its own time. Some she visited daily. Others, only when the moon was right.

Most people never saw the caches. They only saw her return, jugs full, robes dusted with the scent of stone. They believed in miracles. She believed in memory, clay, and the patience of water.

Elizabeth's husband, Zechariah, had other duties.  Each morning he set out on the long road to Jerusalem, five miles of dust and stone, and each evening he returned by the same path. He walked alone, steady as the sun, and few ever troubled him.

He passed the bath‑house, where Romans lounged without shame, their laughter echoing against marble walls. The audacity of their bathing made him blush, and he turned his eyes to the ground. He passed the latrines, which the foreigners called “Johns,” and he held his nose against the stench.

Yet he loved the walk. The rhythm of his steps was prayer, the silence between villages was scripture. The hills folded around him like psalms, and the road itself became his sanctuary.

At the end of his journey he took his place among the head priests, robes heavy with duty, voice steady with ritual. And when the day was done, he returned to Ein Karem, to Elizabeth, to the quiet patience of water and clay.

There was a longing in them for a child, but many years had come and gone. Elizabeth, though healthy and still remarkably beautiful, was in her fifties. Her face carried the patience of water, her hands the memory of clay.

Zechariah loved her, yet he was bound by his own interpretations of his oaths. He was of a sect that said, “God is my Father,” and in his mind, desire was dangerous, lust a sin—even for his own wife.

So their longing remained unspoken, folded into silence. Elizabeth tended her hidden springs, Zechariah walked his lonely road. They believed in miracles, yet lived by restraint. And the years passed, dust upon dust, until longing itself became a prayer.

Then one day, the Caravan of the Fifth Wind rolled into town, with exotic music, entertainment, and food. Of particular appeal was the exotic wine, brought out by Odys the Vintner, fortunes told by Belzar the Astrologer, and dentistry and midwifery offered by Durvasini the healer. 

Belzar lifted his hands and said, “In the 21st year of the reign of Augustus, while Herod is king, in this month of 29 Sivan, behold—the great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in Pisces! Any child conceived beneath this sign may fulfill prophecy, and salvation may come to the world.”

Elizabeth joked with Zechariah, saying "Imagine if our first conception were tonight" 

Zechariah smiled, said, "Well, perhaps. If prophecy must be fulfilled." 

Elizabeth paused. Reflected. "I will talk to their midwife." 

Zechariah laughed gently, but Elizabeth was on her way.

Elizabeth found Durvasini in her tent. She waited as a brave young man endured her tongs in his mouth. Elizabeth was surprised to see a number of small nuggets of pure gold lying on the table beside her. As she watched, Durvasini pressed a pack of frankincense or myrrh into the young man’s bleeding mouth.

“After that feels a little better, we will insert the filling. I will start to shape it now.”

Durvasini took up her tongs and held one of the tiny nuggets of gold over a flame. When it was hot and malleable, she shaped it with a hammer until it matched precisely the hollow left by the pulled tooth. the hollow left by the pulled tooth.

With the young man still holding the pack in his mouth, Durvasini turns to Elizabeth.  "Hello, can I do anything for you?"

With the young man still holding the pack in his mouth, Durvasini turned to Elizabeth. “Hello. Can I do anything for you?”

Elizabeth answered, “Probably not. I am being very silly. Your astrologer mentioned that someone born under tonight’s sign might fulfill a prophecy.”

“Conceived,” Durvasini smiled.

“Right, conceived,” said Elizabeth. “It is hope beyond hope, but my husband is a very religious man, and one not disinclined to fulfill prophecy.”

“You think you may be too old to conceive, yet you would still like to try. What is his name?”

“His name is Zechariah.”

“That is an auspicious name indeed. And you may well be a prophetess. Therefore make no compromise. You will set the terms, and he will fulfill them. Tell him to bring the Torah, and I will have him speak with Gabriel.”

When Zechariah arrived, he was met by Odys, Durvasini, and Belzar. The three stood together like keepers of a secret, each bearing their gift. Odys leaned upon his oar, the wood worn smooth by sea and soil. Durvasini’s hands were dusted with gold, the scent of frankincense still rising from her tent. Belzar lifted his eyes to the sky, where Jupiter and Saturn burned close in their dance.

They greeted Zechariah not as strangers but as companions of prophecy. Odys offered him wine, dark and fragrant, saying, “For the journey ahead.” Durvasini placed her hand upon his arm and said, “For the healing of what is broken.” Belzar spoke last, his voice steady as the stars: “For the child yet to be conceived, under this sign, in this hour.”

Zechariah listened, robes heavy with duty, heart caught between oath and longing. He thought of Elizabeth, waiting in the quiet patience of water and clay. And he wondered if prophecy had indeed come to his door.

“Elizabeth said you would introduce me to someone named Gabriel,” Zechariah said to Durvasini.

“And perhaps I will,” Durvasini replied. She reached into her pack and drew out a small scroll. “Gabriel is an angel, and it is for you to see him or not. I can only offer you this, if you would read it.” She placed Kunti’s mantra in his hands. “If it makes any sense to you, have Elizabeth repeat it.”

Zechariah took the scroll with trepidation and read. The letters were in no language he knew, yet they made a strange sense. The three lit incense and stepped outside the tent, waiting for him to emerge. They wondered why he lingered so long within.

When he came out, Zechariah could not speak to them. He turned instead toward Ein Karem, where Elizabeth awaited him in the patience of water and clay.

---

Zechariah arrived by the spring where he had been told Elizabeth waited. This was all a bit too public for him. The place for procreation was behind a locked door, in darkness—not here, under the whole sky. Yet the messenger had explained to him that he had to allow Elizabeth to please him her way, or the act would fail.

He saw her—Elizabeth—already in the water. She was not veiled. Her hair floated. Her body moved with the current. She was not performing. She was simply being. He did not speak. He watched. She turned to him, smiling—not seductively, but openly, divinely. “The water is clean,” she said. “Come in.”

He did not move. He could not speak. She saw him—too shy, too nervous, fearful of breaking some obscure edict of ancient scripture he might have missed. “We are alone,” she said. “Only the eyes of God are upon us.” But this only made poor Zechariah even more nervous.

She dipped beneath the surface, then rose, water streaming from her arms like ritual oil. “I am fertile,” she said. “The messenger told you.” He nodded. But no words came.

Then Elizabeth arose from the water, stepping toward him, placing a hand on his chest. He felt the warmth, the pulse. His desire overcame his worry, and he leaned forward, kissing her. She took his hands and guided them, knowing he was not bold enough to take such liberties on his own.

In Zechariah’s mind, the prophecy took shape. He would make love to the prophetess, and name the child Maher Shalal Hash Baz. “His name is John.”

Zechariah returned the very next day to work at the temple, but he quickly became a curiosity to the other workers. He seemed to be refusing to speak. Finally someone asked him, “Have you taken a vow of silence?” Zechariah gave one slow nod, indicating at least that it was something like that.

The workers looked to the Torah and to scripture and asked what precedent such a vow might have. They found it in 1 Kings 19: Elijah sought God in thunder, fire, and earthquake—but found Him in the kol demamah dakah, the still small voice. This phrase was often translated as “the sound of a slender silence.” It suggested that God was most present in quietude, not spectacle.

Zechariah imagined fearfully Elijah’s destruction of the prophets, worried if Elizabeth herself was a prophet. He was troubled by his thoughts. The tongue revealed what was in the soul. From a righteous soul sprang righteous words, and from a sinful soul sprang sinful words. Yet the images of his own wife he could not remove from his mind. And she was not helping him during this time, renewing the images each evening through her voracious appetites. At one point, Elizabeth even mentioned Asherah. He fearfully opened the Torah, trying to recall how Elijah had dealt with her worshipers.

He read how Jezebel became very angry at Elijah for what he did to the prophets of Asherah. But when he went back through the account, he noticed a subtlety. Elijah committed the prophets of Baal to the flame—had them chased down and executed. But as for the prophets of Asherah, they remained unmolested. The only thing done, he surmised, was that they converted to worship Elijah’s God.

Elizabeth spoke playfully, saying he had learned to accept God’s greatest gift in silence, rather than worrying so much about what he must say, or how he must judge. “If it is a worry to you, ask God for a sign. Go up to the hilltop, and watch the horizon at dawn or dusk. If God gives you a thumbs up, you are on the right track.”

Zechariah imagined Elijah on Mount Carmel, waiting for the sign of rain.

Since Zechariah could not speak, Elizabeth went with him the first morning. They waited together, watching the stars fade with the dawn. Elizabeth had often been up in these hills at this time, gathering water from the springs. Her early walks had led to one of her nicknames, the “dew woman” or the “dew collector.” Many times she had gazed into the sunrise and seen the green flash.

“It will be a green thumb,” she said. “It represents someone who knows how to make the ground fertile. And my, don’t you know how to do that now!” After a little while she said, “It will be a thumbs up, telling you you’re on the right path. All of this red is stop, stop, stop. And most of the time, discretion is the better part of valor. But sometimes…”

As if on cue, the green flashed. “There, look, do you see it?” she asked. Zechariah did not speak, but he saw. Chills went down his back. The green flash was over before he even had a chance to doubt. If Elizabeth had not spoken, he would have thought it was his imagination. He nodded, gazing at her in wonder.

“Sometimes,” she said. “Sometimes God gives you the green light.” Then she kissed him under the sun‑lit stars.

Soon after, Elizabeth was in labor. Zechariah prayed that there would be no complications, and waited nearby, listening to her push the child into the world. He sat down, knowing he had made love to a prophetess, knowing that the child was to be named John, and knowing he had one more thing to do.

It was still hard for him to believe that he might be part of prophecy. Even so much that yesterday and tomorrow he might deny he had anything to do with it. But at this time, he had only to take a simple pen, and write on a simple scroll: Maher Shalal Hash Baz. He had thought long and hard about this name. In his heart, his son would be Yohanon, “God is Gracious”—a counterpoint to justice, a herald of mercy. But on paper, the name would be John, a word he had heard sometimes cast about by people from the great island nation in the far west, asking where the toilets were, or looking around for prostitutes. No one here need know the meaning. It was enough that God would know. But if it were a girl, he did not know. He might have to change his plan drastically.

Elizabeth was surprised to see the scroll. “His name is John? Dear, that is not a Hebrew name at all. Surely, aren’t you too seeped in our traditions to create your own path?”

She held the scroll, her brow furrowed. The name was clear: John. “His name is John?” she asked, softly but firmly. “Dear, that is not a Hebrew name at all. Surely, aren’t you too seeped in our traditions to create your own path?”

Zechariah did not speak. He could not. But he looked at her—not with defiance, but with depth. He touched the scroll, then his heart, then the sky. He found his voice. “His Jewish name, I could never pronounce, any more than I can express the beauty of your face, or the heartache of the sunset. But John.”

“But John…” she continued. “What about Yohanon? Mercy. Grace. John is… foreign.”

“I could have written Yohanon. But what I have written, I have written. Sometimes a child is so special, his name must be taken from whole cloth.”

“Whole cloth,” she said, taking the scroll. “His name is John. I like it. He will do great things, unbound by precedent or prophecy.”

Yet Zechariah worried quietly, silently, only to himself: What prophecies ought be fulfilled by Maher Shalal Hash Baz?
