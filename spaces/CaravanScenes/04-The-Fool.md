In the 28th year of the reign of Augustus while Herod was king  Draupa, Draupi, Joseph, Mary, Elizabeth, and Zechariah met as they sometimes did, in Sychar.  The children were playing. 

John had boasted that he could outrun any one of the Apu Pandas. 

They laughed.  "You, a seven year-old will outrun us?"

Seven year old Bara Bas decided to make a little game of it.  "John, you and I will play house.  I'll play Gaia, and you'll play Cronus.  We'll have six babies, and then you have to try to catch and devour them.  Prat, you're the oldest.  She shouts: Hestia, Son of Cronus and Gaia! Go!"

Prat starts out running, but doesn't quite expect the flash of John.  John catches Prat by the wrist and drags him over to Jacob's well.  Cronus devours Hestia!"

Prat plays along and hides behind the well.

Likewise when Soma plays the game, Bara shouts "Demeter, Son of Cronus and Gaia!" and John once again easily catches him.

"Hera, Daughter of Cronus and Gaia".  While Karman complains, "Hey, why do I have to be a daughter?" John catches his wrist and drags him to the well.

"Hades, Son of Cronus and Gaia" - Nika succumbs to the game. And finally, "Poseidon, Son of Cronus and Gaia!"  

Sena makes a good run, but John catches him breathlessly.

Bara Bas turns to Jesus.  Hmmm.  I guess it's your turn.  Jesus turns and picks up a stone, and lays a piece of his robe over it.  

Bara chuckles and shouts "Cephas, Son of John."

Jesus reminds her "Son of Cronus and Gaia?"  

Bara laughs, and shouts "Cephas, Son of Cronus and Gaia.  It means Peter in aramaic.  Which means rock."

John rushes up to Bara, and takes the stone and runs back and tosses it directly into the well, with a big splash.

"Hey," shouts Zechariah, "Don't be throwing rocks down in the well.  And don't waste good cloth like that."

"Sorry, dad!" shouts John.

As the kids played, Mary said to Draupi, "So can I hear one of these riddles?"

Draupi says, "Sure, I will tell you one.
