In the 28th year of the reign of Augustus while Herod was king  Draupa, Draupi, Joseph, Mary, Elizabeth, and Zechariah met as they sometimes did, in Sychar.  The children were playing. 

John had boasted that he could outrun any one of the Apu Pandas. 

They laughed.  "You, a seven year-old will outrun us?"

Seven year old Bara Bas decided to make a little game of it.  "John, you and I will play house.  I'll play Gaia, and you'll play Cronus.  We'll have six babies, and then you have to try to catch and devour them.  Prat, you're the oldest.  She shouts: Hestia, Son of Cronus and Gaia! Go!"

Prat starts out running, but doesn't quite expect the flash of John.  John catches Prat by the wrist and drags him over to Jacob's well.  Cronus devours Hestia!"

Prat plays along and hides behind the well.

Likewise when Soma plays the game, Bara shouts "Demeter, Son of Cronus and Gaia!" and John once again easily catches him.

"Hera, Daughter of Cronus and Gaia".  While Karman complains, "Hey, why do I have to be a daughter?" John catches his wrist and drags him to the well.

"Hades, Son of Cronus and Gaia" - Nika succumbs to the game. And finally, "Poseidon, Son of Cronus and Gaia!"  

Sena makes a good run, but John catches him breathlessly.

Bara Bas turns to Jesus.  Hmmm.  I guess it's your turn.  Jesus turns and picks up a stone, and lays a piece of his robe over it.  

Bara chuckles and shouts "Cephas, Son of John."

Jesus reminds her "Son of Cronus and Gaia?"  

Bara laughs, and shouts "Cephas, Son of Cronus and Gaia.  It means Peter in aramaic.  Which means rock."

John rushes up to Bara, and takes the stone and runs back and tosses it directly into the well, with a big splash.

"Hey," shouts Zechariah, "Don't be throwing rocks down in the well.  And don't waste good cloth like that."

"Sorry, dad!" shouts John.

As the kids played, Mary said to Draupi, "So can I hear one of these riddles?"

Draupi said, "Sure, I will tell you one.  

*What* word would come ‘round be*tween* noun and noun. 
*What* is the distance be*tween* freed and bound?
*What* word does God put be*tween* Earth and sun? 
*What* word without which no *thing* can be done? 
I *tell* you and tell you and *tell* you both, and 
I *rid*dle you this and I *hide* it in hand. 

The others ponder her riddle, 

Zechariah said, "The distance between freed and bound.  Hmmm.  Would that be a key?"

Joseph said, "Or a chisel.  Something to break the chains."

Zechariah said, "But you don't put a key or a chisel between the earth and sun.  All we have there is air."

Mary adds "or space." 

Elizabeth said, "Wait... space...  Between nouns...  Between the free and the bound...  Between earth and sun.  Yes...  I think it works!"

Zechariah and Joseph nod.

Draupi said, "You're all so close."

Jesus, John, and Draupi's children ran up, and the riddle was told again.  Bara and the apu panda's already knew the riddle so they kept quiet.  

Jesus said, "with time, the bound can become free, and things can get done.  But you can't hide time in your hand."

Bara laughed, "You could if you had a tiny sun-dial."

John said, "I think I got it."

Draupi said, "Go ahead, dear."

John said, "It's the word 'and'"

Draupi said, "That's correct, Mr. Oedipus.  You've solved the Sphinxes riddle."

Mary said, "Do you have any more?"

Draupi began, 

---
>*What* word is come between *word* and connotation  
*What* word implies being *and* classification?  
To de*fine*, interpret, de*ter*mine a meaning,  
the *light* of life, “Is”, is *al*ways revealing

>When *God* brought a beast before *Ad*am and called  
“*What* do you think this beast *ought* to be called?”  
Adam began to form words with his mouth  
to name all the livestock and birds and the trout. 

>*Each* beast and bird had u*nique* marks and features  
but *one* or two syllables *summed* every creature.  
This *sym*bolic thinking was *real*ly a feat  
known *on*ly to those walking *on* two hind feet  

>They *had* to use verbs of pec*u*liar type:  
These *verbs*, referential, don’t *get* too much hype  
when *anth*ropomorphized I *say* these are me,  
and *you* can call me the words “*Is*”, “Are” or “Be”  

Who am I?

---

Karman said, "Well that's easy.  You put the answer in the question."

Zechariah confesses, "I didn't catch it."

Karman says, "It's the referential verbs, "Is, are, be" 

Sena, who has heard this riddle before, adds,

>When *“and”* in conjunction cre*ates* ambiguity  
Those *seek*ing consensus find *dis*continuity  
One *might* find the same, or dif*fer*ent propostions.  
For “*and*” can show cause, or con*vey* apposition  
A *list* or identity; *you* cannot know  
If *auth*ors do not make pre*cis*ion their goal

Zechariah asked, "Apposition?"

Sena said, "Apposition is just an adjacency of concepts.  It doesn't imply parallelism or cause or reference."

Karman said, "The referential versbs don't imply reference?"

Sena said, "Oh, sorry, I was going back to the 'and' riddle.  Yes, "is", "are", and "be" definitely imply a reference.  All relating symbols, names, identifiable concepts, and things.   But "and" and other conjunctions can merely mean apposition."

Prat asked, "The answers that Mary and Jesus brought up... space and time...  Are they similarly inclined?"

Sena said, "Yes, indeed just a space between words, whether distance on a paper, or time between spoken words, similarly implies at least apposition, though it can also represent cause, or parallel, or even reference."

Zechariah said, "I'm sorry, my hearing isn't so good."

In that moment, a dove came down next to them.  Jesus happened to have a bit of grain in his pocket, so he tried to coax the dove forward.

Bara said, "Jonah Nathanael, A dove giving the grace of God."

John said, "What do you think it's saying?"

Bara said, "It's saying Jesus of Nazareth?  Is there anything good that can come from there?"

John said, "Like Jonah coming to preach against the Ninevites."

Jesus says, "Now here is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit."

Jesus scatters the seed on the ground.  And the dove hops forward to eat some.

Bara says, "... and Nathanael says, 'how do you know me?'"

Jesus says, "Why I saw you under that fig tree!"

The dove continues eating.  

Bara says, "Truly you are the Messiah, The Son of the Living God."

Jesus laughs, "You say that because I saw you under a fig tree?"

Bara says, "I'll show you more than that, little bird.  Soon you will see angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man."

After a little while, the bird has had it's fill.  It flutters right up to Bara, rests a moment, and poops a little before fluttering off.

Bara laughs, "Yuck!  The spirit has come down on me as a dove, and remained on me."

Nika said, "Well, your prophet Ezekiel baked his food over burning cow dung...  Maybe, Bara, this is a sign that you'll build your ministry on dove poo."

John says, "Sounds like you two have your work cut out for you.  Messiah and Daughter of Man."

Draupi said, "It's nearly four.  We should go inside for dinner."

Bara says, "Better go get Cephas."

John says, "But I threw Cephas down the well.  Anyway, Cephas is a sissy name for a rock."

Bara says, "Well there's another rock about the same size.  We can call him Andrew.  A manly gift.  A brave one."

John takes the rock named Andrew, and brings it over to the well.  He shouts, (in Andrew's voice)  "Hey Cephas 'hearing Peter' we have found the Messiah, and the Son of Man...  Pretty sure at least one of them is the Christ."

John (in Cephas feminine voice) "Where is the Christ staying?"  

John (in Andrew's masculine voice)  "It's about four.  I think we're having dinner!"

John (in Cephas feminine voice), "You go.  For now, I'll just stay here and drink this water."
