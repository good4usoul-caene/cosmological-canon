### Notes
- **Herod the Great’s full name**: *Herod I, known as Herod the Great, King of Judea*.  
- Archelaus ruled Judea from **4 BCE–6 CE** as ethnarch, before being deposed by Augustus.  
- After Archelaus, Judea was governed directly by Rome, with prefects such as **Pontius Pilate (26–36 CE)**.  
- John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution are generally placed between **26–30 CE**, under Herod Antipas’s authority.

In the 33rd year of the reign of Augustus during the deposition of Herod Archelaus ethnarchy of Judea, Draupi, her five sons, and her daughter Bara went to a wedding in Cana, which also served as Bara Bas's Bas Mitzveh.  Elizabeth, Zechariah, Mary, Joseph and Jesus, and the Caravan of the Fifth Wind was also there.  

For Belzar, Cana was an important place, mirroring the constellation of Pisces across Judea and Phoenicia.  Cana, to him, represented the brightest star in Pisces.  And this day was about nine months after the 12th year since the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in Pisces.  

For Durvasini, as always, there was much work to be done.  Teeth to be pulled, and aches to be soothed, advice to be given.  

For Odys, this wedding was a great opportunity to sell his wine.  And the accounts were already settled.  But the guests were still finishing off some wine of inferior quality.

The feast was joyous, yet whispers of politics filled the air. Roman officials had arrived to oversee the census, and the people muttered against the tribute demanded by Caesar.

Draupi, already a little tipsy, stood up to announce, "I would like to make an announcement.  Today my littlest one, my daugher Bara, is turning twelve.  She is my salvation, and so I want everyone to feel free to call her Jesusa Bar Abas.  Which means Yahweh is salvation Daughter of Creation.  Now... does everyone have enough wine?"

A servant said, "No, we've just run out."

Draupi turned to Bara and said, "Jesusa, they have no more wine."

Bara said "Woman, why do you involve me?  My hour has not yet come."

His mother said to the servant, "Do whatever he tells you," nodding to Odys, then to Bara.

Nearby stood six stone water jars, about 25 gallons each, with spigots at the very bottom.  Odys had brought them in.

Jesusa Bara Bas inspected the jars.  In the top they were empty, but her keen eye could see that the bottom of the jars were not level with the floor.  Likely Odys had filled the bottom section of each jar with four or five gallons of his premium wine.

She sighed, "Fill the jars with water."  So the servants lined up, and transferred buckets all the way from the well to the stone jars.  When finally the first jar was filled, Jesusa said,  “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.”

One servant brought the wine to Jesus of Nazareth, who took a small sip.  "Mmmm, very good.  This is much better than the wine you had before."  

Herod Antipas, who was there with his newlywed, Herodias, said, "Are you going to drink all that, young man?"  

Jesus said, "Ah no...  Moderation for me.  Would you like to have the rest?  Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine aftter the guests have had too much to drink, but you have saved the best till now"

"Not me!" said Herod Antipas, "It was that young lady over there performing a miracle of transmutation."

Jesus laughs, "Sure.  But man does not live on wine alone, but every word that falls from the mouth of God."

Later, Bara was enjoying the wine freely.  "Kapro-Naum!  she shouted.  Pig Village"  

She climbed up a few steps of a ladder to a high loft over the banquet room.  

With one hand on the ladder she turns and says "Circe turns all you drunks into pigs, and I'm Elpenor, climbing up to the top of the temple!  

She climbs a few more steps, and turns again:  "But I'm not worried, God will send his angels to protect me!"

Draupadi says, "Bara, please!  That's not safe!"

And some of the acrobats from the Caravan of the Five Winds rush up, many saying, "Dear girl, we're not set up for this, and you're quite drunk.  Someone is likely to get seriously injured."

In the top of the loft, Bara finds a cache of coins.  She dumps the chest onto the floor of the loft, then sprawls in them, knocking some of them down onto the acrobats below.  "Get these out of here!  Stop turning my father's house into a market!"

"Hey, hey!  That's not your money!" said the town treasurer.  

But another Jew, wanting to see the feat, asked,  “What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?”

Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”

The banai, or architect said, “It has taken forty-six months to build this town hall, and you are going to raise it in three days?” 

But the temple she had spoken of was her body. And she threw herself down, with faith that the acrobats would catch her.  Which they did, but not without minor injury.

After she was deposited safely on the floor, she said to the acrobats, "I knew you could do it."  And because of her faith in them, they believed in her, even the one who'd taken her foot in his face.

Jesusa Bara Bas continued to drink, and enjoy herself.  She danced with many.  And because of the dances, many believed in her, and her name.  Eventually, though, Jesusa had too much, and passed out.  Jesus of Nazareth stood guard over her while she was unconscious.  He stood by her until she was taken into a private room.  He would not entrust her to anyone else, because he knew what was in some people.
