02-The-Conception-of-Bara-Bas

In the little village of sychar, 40 miles north of Jerusalem, and near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph, lived a woman who frequently drew water from Jacob's well, Draupadi, her father Draupada, and her five sons, Vindan (or Prat), Soma, Karmin, Nika, and Sena, ages 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.  

Her father Draupada was a care-free soul, who used to study a great deal, but since the onset of old-age, found that his far-sightedness kept the texts out-of-reach. 

Draupadi had a great love of riddles, and practiced the Liknon with some of her friends.  They would put baskets on top of their heads with the answers of riddles they would tell.  Whoever answered correctly would get a lovely dance.

Men from the far-east would come as a pilgrimmage and visit Draupadi for her riddles, and more.  In five years, five men of Brahmin or Kshatriya caste had come to visit her.  They took her hand in marriage, then spent a whole year each enjoying her company.  Each of them had one child by her, and then went back to become leaders of nations or churches in their nations.

The men of Sychar somewhat looked down on Draupadi because of the way she was loved and left by these men, but they would say nothing out of respect for her father.  

Then one day, the Caravan of the Fifth Wind rolled into town, with exotic music, entertainment, and food. Of particular appeal was the exotic wine, brought out by Odys the Vintner, fortunes told by Belzar the Astrologer, and dentistry and midwifery offered by Durvasini the healer. 

Belzar lifted his hands and said, “In the 21st year of the reign of Augustus, while Herod is king, on this the 30th of Tishrei, behold—the great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in Pisces! Any child conceived beneath this sign may fulfill prophecy, and salvation may come to the world.”

The crowd murmured. Some laughed, some trembled. Draupadi stood still, her eyes fixed on the astrologer. She remembered the riddles she had told, the dances she had given, the children she had borne. She thought of the sixth child she had prayed for, the daughter she longed to call Bara Bas, Creation’s Daughter.

Durvasini stepped forward, her hands dusted with gold. “The sign is true,” she said. “But prophecy is not spectacle. It is conceived in silence, born in tears, raised in patience. Draupadi, if you would receive this gift, take Kunti’s mantra and speak it beneath the stars.”

Odys poured wine into a clay cup and offered it to Draupada, who laughed and said, “I cannot read the texts anymore, but I can taste the wine. And prophecy tastes sweet tonight.”

The music of the Caravan rose, and the people of Sychar gathered at Jacob’s Well. Some came for riddles, some for healing, some for wine. But Draupadi came for tears, and Belzar’s words echoed in her heart: Any child conceived beneath this sign may fulfill prophecy.

And the people of Sychar marveled, but Draupadi wept. For even as the zygote took root, she felt it deep in her bones that Bara Bas, Creation’s Daughter, would suffer when Dushasana’s dice were rolled again—casting lots for her robe, and for the robes of the others born beneath this sign. Prophecy is never gentle, and Bara was its child.
