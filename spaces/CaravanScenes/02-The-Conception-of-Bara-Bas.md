In the little village of Sychar, 40 miles north of Jerusalem, and near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph, lived a woman who frequently drew water from Jacob's well, Draupi, her father Draupa, and her "Baby Pandas", Vindan (or Prat), Soma, Karmin, Nika, and Sena, ages 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.  Each one of her sons looked a bit foreign here, as their fathers were all East Asian.  

Her father Draupa was a care-free soul, who used to study a great deal, but since the onset of old age, found that his far-sightedness kept the texts out of reach. 

Draupi had a great love of riddles, and practiced the Liknon with some of her friends.  They would put baskets on top of their heads with the answers of riddles they would tell.  Whoever answered correctly would get a lovely dance.

Men from the far-east would come as a pilgrimage and visit Draupi for her riddles, and more.  In five years, five men of Brahmin or Kshatriya caste had come to visit her.  They took her hand in marriage, then spent a whole year each enjoying her company.  Each of them had one child by her, and then went back to become leaders of nations or churches in their nations.  It was quite polyandrous, though some thought of her as a widow.  

Some men of Sychar somewhat looked down on Draupi because of the way she was loved and left by these men, but they would say nothing out of respect for her father.  

Then one day, the Caravan of the Fifth Wind rolled into town, with exotic music, entertainment, and food. Of particular appeal was the exotic wine, brought out by Odys the Vintner, fortunes told by Belzar the Astrologer, and dentistry and midwifery offered by Durvasini the healer. 

Belzar lifted his hands and said, “In the 21st year of the reign of Augustus, while Herod is king, on this the 30th of Tishrei, behold—the great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in Pisces! Any child conceived beneath this sign may fulfill prophecy, and salvation may come to the world.”

The crowd murmured. Some laughed, some trembled. Draupi stood still, her eyes fixed on the astrologer. She remembered the riddles she had told, the dances she had given, the children she had borne. She thought of the sixth child she had prayed for, the daughter she longed to call Bara Bas, Creation’s Daughter.

Durvasini stepped forward, her hands dusted with gold. “The sign is true,” she said. “But prophecy is not spectacle. It is conceived in silence, born in tears, raised in patience. Draupi, if you would receive this gift, take Kunti’s mantra and speak it beneath the stars.”

Odys poured wine into a clay cup and offered it to Draupa, who laughed and said, “I cannot read the texts anymore, but I can taste the wine. And prophecy tastes sweet tonight.”

The music of the Caravan rose, and the people of Sychar gathered at Jacob’s Well. Some came for riddles, some for healing, some for wine. But Draupi came for tears, and Belzar’s words echoed in her heart: Any child conceived beneath this sign may fulfill prophecy.

And the people of Sychar marveled, but Draupi wept. For even as the zygote took root, she felt it deep in her bones that Bara Bas, Creation’s Daughter, would suffer when Dushasana’s dice were rolled again—casting lots for her robe, and for the robes of the others born beneath this sign. Prophecy is never gentle, and Bara was its child.

As she invoked Kunti's mantra, she tried to think upon a God of peace, but her mind was on the hurricane... the typhoon...  (*Job 38:1*) The Lord spoke to Job from out of the storm...  And that same storm was speaking to Kunti, offering her the Queen of the South.  The Queen of Sheba.  The woman who had questioned Solomon, and the Sphinx who had questioned Oedipus.  Through this daughter, the riddles would be given.  

"The Queen of the South" she whispered, "will rise at the judgment and condemn this generation, because she traveled from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom." (*Mat 12:42, Luke 11:31*)

And so the Queen of the South was invoked, her riddles rising like storm‑winds. Bara Bas would judge this generation, for she had traveled far to hear Solomon’s wisdom. But now, beneath the stars of Pisces, Draupi asked: will she find one greater than Solomon here?

When Bara Bas was born, Draupi and her midwife saw that a son had been born.  Draupi was disappointed, and she decided to swear the midwife to secrecy.  She would raise her as a girl, (the Sphinx, the Queen of Sheba, the Queen of the South).  Only when puberty came would anyone realize this was a boy.  She gave her the name "Bara Bas"; Creation's Daughter.  When she came of age, she would change her name to "Bar Abba", Son of the Father.  

But for now, Draupi wanted to enjoy having a girl child.
