📜 Chapter 3: Nazareth
And Odys, the Vintner, came to Nazareth, where the fields were golden with harvest. He carried his oar‑staff upon his shoulder, for the Caravan of the Fifth Wind had brought him inland.

Mary, young and bright, was winnowing wheat in the field. She saw Odys and said, “Sir, may I please try out that winnowing fan? It looks like a design I have never tried before.”

Odys gave her the oar‑staff. She lifted it, tested it, and said, “Well, this winnowing fan is no good at all. It pushes both the wheat and the chaff forward, without prejudice. Thank you, sir, but this will not do.”

Odys remembered the words of Tiresias in the Odyssey: “Carry the oar inland until someone mistakes the oar for a winnowing fan, and there build a temple to Poseidon.”

And Odys marveled, for the prophecy was fulfilled before his eyes. This young girl had mistaken the oar for a winnowing fan, so his was the task to dedicate a temple to Poseidon.  But her task might be even greater yet, still.

That night he rejoined the Caravan as Belzar lifted his hands and said, “In the 21st year of the reign of Augustus while Herod is king, On this the Fifth of Kislev, behold—the great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in Pisces! Any child conceived beneath this sign may fulfill prophecy, and salvation may come to the world.” 

There were some women that volunteered to have their fortunes read by Belzar, and to come up to consider whether they ought to conceive a child under this sign. One woman came up to say that she was barren, but she'd still like to try any miracle cures they had to offer. Durvasani looked her over, and found there was nothing she could do. Except... She pulled the mysterious scroll from her purse. "This is called Kunti's Mantra. If you read it and invoke the God you most desire, it invites him to implant you with a child." The woman read the scroll aloud, and finally said, "I don't think it is working. I really don't believe in *any* gods." Meanwhile, outside, Mary listened, and hearing Kunti's Mantra, she said, "But I believe in God."
