Overview
--------
Below are the eight High Bars the author (I) considers necessary for the kinematic cosmology to be observationally and conceptually viable. Each entry is intentionally concise and testable so future work can convert these into calculations or models.

High Bar 1 — Blackbody Spectral Fidelity
- Interpretation: The model must preserve the CMB’s near‑perfect Planck spectrum: spectral distortions (μ, y) must remain below observational limits.
- Distinction: ΛCDM explains spectral purity via thermalization before last scattering; this model must show that a rapidity‑layered photosphere and intervening molecular hydrogen do not introduce measurable μ/y distortions.
- Relevance: COBE/FIRAS and successor constraints: μ ≲ 9×10⁻⁵, y ≲ 1.5×10⁻⁵.
- Minimal Test: Compute cumulative energy injection and Compton y from regions behind the photosphere; show predicted μ,y within observational bounds.
- Jonathan's Exact Words:
  - "Diatomic Hydrogen Transparency Claim: molecular H₂ is absorption‑transparent across 2.73 K → 3000 K, so a layered veil can let a near-perfect Planck spectrum pass unmolested to the observer."

High Bar 2 — Angular Power Spectrum & Polarization (TT/TE/EE)
- Interpretation: The model must account for the existence of spatial waves or sound-like phenomena in dense gas that could produce regions of differing density; it is not required to predict the exact frequencies or grain sizes of those waves.
- Distinction: ΛCDM derives peaks from photon–baryon oscillations in an expanding metric. The kinematic model acknowledges the possibility of sound and waves traveling through dense gas; reproducing precise peak positions is not required at the outset so long as a plausible mechanism for coherent waves is present.
- Relevance: Peak-like structure and polarization patterns are precise observables; the model must show it does not preclude wave phenomena that could imprint spatial structure.
- Minimal Test: Demonstrate that the layered medium can support coherent acoustic or density waves and estimate the qualitative scales of resulting density contrasts; show these do not inevitably destroy spectral fidelity.
- Jonathan's Exact Words:
  - "As long as my theory acknowledges the possibility of sound and waves traveling through the dense gas (and it does), leading to regions of lesser and higher density, it is not necessary to predict the frequencies of such waves, or the size of the grains."

High Bar 3 — Sharp Visibility Function (Thin Photosphere)
- Interpretation: The effective visibility function in rapidity (𝜑) must be sharply peaked so the blackbody emission behaves observationally like a single photosphere even when embedded in layered structure.
- Distinction: ΛCDM has a narrow recombination visibility in conformal time; here the peak must be shown in 𝜑‑space despite layered “peel‑offs.”
- Relevance: Sharpness preserves the Planck spectrum and prevents excessive line-of‑sight spectral mixing.
- Minimal Test: Compute τ(𝜑) and the visibility g(𝜑) for candidate molecular/atomic cross sections and demonstrate a narrow peak (Δ𝜑 ≪ 1, or justify a different acceptable Δ𝜑 with corresponding opacity calculation).
- Jonathan's Exact Words:
  - "I think a even a photosphere rapidity depth of .01 or .001 or .000001 would make it completely opaque to the light coming from beyond."

High Bar 4 — Dipole Consistency & Multipole Scope
- Interpretation: The model must account for the observed dipole anisotropy in a geometrically consistent way; it may accept the observed dipole amplitude as input rather than predicting it from first principles.
- Distinction: ΛCDM interprets the dipole as peculiar velocity within metric expansion. The kinematic framing treats the dipole as rapidity‑induced image asymmetry relative to a hypothetical particle that has not accelerated since the Big Bang.
- Relevance: The dipole is the largest anisotropy; higher multipoles remain precise tests but may be treated as open research targets in this model.
- Minimal Test: Show geometric derivation of dipole direction and sign in the rapidity image framework; state explicitly whether amplitude is input or predicted and why.
- Jonathan's Exact Words:
  - "This cosmology offers a geometric explanation for the observed dipole anisotropy in the CMB, attributing it to the observer’s motion relative to a hypothetical particle that has not accelerated since the Big Bang. The dipole arises naturally from relativistic image aging and directional compression. However, the model does not predict the magnitude of the dipole from first principles. It accepts the observed value as input, not output."
  - "Likewise, the model does not currently predict the higher‑order multipoles—the quadrupole, octopole, and beyond. These features... are acknowledged but not derived."

High Bar 5 — Global Consistency of the Hubble Event
- Interpretation: The Hubble Event (the kinematic threshold where local masses become inertially sovereign) must be defined so its global transformation properties under boosts/Lorentz maps are consistent and do not produce contradictions between observers.
- Distinction: ΛCDM treats Hubble flow as metric expansion everywhere. Here the Event is a phase/threshold in 𝜑‑space; its global behavior must be shown to be well‑posed.
- Relevance: Consistency across frames prevents empirically observable paradoxes and preserves predictive coherence.
- Minimal Test: Formulate the Hubble Event as a covariant condition (in Milne/rapidity language) and demonstrate how two inertial observers transform the Event without contradiction.
- Jonathan's Exact Words:
  - "The Hubble Event is the moment when local galactic masses achieve a mean‑free path of infinity — i.e., they become dynamically decoupled and inertially sovereign."

High Bar 6 — Quantum Expansion Floor
- Interpretation: The model requires a quantum floor: a minimum relative velocity (set by Δx·Δp ≥ ħ/2) sufficient to overcome local gravitational capture at earliest times; this replaces inflation as a mechanism to avoid a singular, gravitationally bound initial state.
- Distinction: ΛCDM uses inflation to set initial conditions. Here a Heisenberg‑imposed rapidity floor supplies initial kinetic dominance.
- Relevance: Provides a physically grounded origin for initial rapidity distribution and prevents gravitational collapse in the earliest regime.
- Minimal Test: Derive a 𝜑‑dependent condition from HUP that places a lower bound on rapidity and show it prevents GPE/KE domination (evaluate GPE/KE as function of 𝜑).
- Jonathan's Exact Words:
  - "Core hypothesis (leading): at t → 0 particles are infinitely compressed and must move apart with a minimum relative velocity imposed by Heisenberg uncertainty, sufficient to overcome the local gravitational field."

High Bar 7 — Primordial Lightning Mechanism (Structure Seeding)
- Interpretation: Without inflationary gravitational seeds, the model must supply a non‑gravitational seeding mechanism (a “lightning”) that can produce the initial inhomogeneities which later grow into galaxies and large‑scale structure.
- Distinction: ΛCDM uses inflationary quantum fluctuations + dark matter gravitational collapse. The kinematic model must present plausible non‑gravitational seeds (e.g., quantum phase transitions, rapidity interference caustics, transient charge separation, directional emission biases).
- Relevance: Structure formation is an observationally central constraint (power spectrum, halo mass function, correlation function).
- Minimal Test: Produce a toy model showing how a candidate lightning mechanism seeds perturbations of sufficient amplitude/spectrum to plausibly grow into observed structure, or show how baryonic/non‑gravitational processes could do so in this framework.
- Jonathan's Exact Words:
  - "Since Milne model begins with perfect gravitational balance, galactic and supergalactic formation must come from non-gravitational imbalances. Primordial lightning (structure mechanism): proposed candidate families include quantum phase transitions at the expansion floor, rapidity interference nodes (caustics), transient charge separation and EM filamentation, or directional emission biases — all speculative and framed as Bar 7."
  - "Milne model accomplishes 'inflation' via the Twin Paradox of thermally excited primordial particles.  The space-time interval of a bouncing particle is much less than the space-time interval of a hypothetical unaccelerated particle.  From the POV of the unaccelerated particle the universe expands at the speed of light.  But from the POV of the bouncing particle, the universe expands much faster."

High Bar 8 — Energetic & Projection Self‑Consistency (Milne Frame)
- Interpretation: The model must show internal energetic consistency in the Milne/rapidity framing: e.g., how rapidity maps to density (linear vs volumetric scalings), how Lorentz projection and image compression produce the claimed local densities (the canonical 1100 factor), and how those densities produce the required opacities.
- Distinction: ΛCDM uses FRW metric energy densities and Friedmann dynamics. This bar demands a consistent kinematic energy bookkeeping (KE vs GPE, scaling laws, and the mapping from 𝜑 to observed quantities).
- Relevance: Demonstrates the model is not merely descriptive but quantitatively coherent; ties together opacity, visibility, and photosphere placement.
- Minimal Test: Provide explicit formulas relating 𝜑 → z, 𝜑 → density scaling (linear vs volumetric hypotheses), and show numerically that the inferred densities yield the opacity/visibility behavior claimed.
- Jonathan's Exact Words:
  - "Clarification: you are not arguing zero total energy density in all senses. The Milne framing used here assumes zero gravitational potential energy density (no curvature/metric deceleration), but kinetic energy density is extremely large at t→0 and dilutes with expansion (rough scaling ∝ 1/t^3)."
  - "If we put z+1 = 1100 = e^{𝜑}, we get a rapidity, and that easily gives us a lorentz contraction... the density of particles in the image of Observer 2 should be assumed to be 1100 times as condensed in each of the three dimensions."

Closing note
------------
These eight bars are intentionally practical: each suggests a minimal calculation or model scaffold that would move the kinematic cosmology from a qualitative proposal to a testable framework. The author (I) invites Euclid (he) and other collaborators to convert these minimal tests into concrete derivations, simulations, or observational checks. Each bar can be expanded into a Canon entry with derivations, references, and a promotion rubric.
