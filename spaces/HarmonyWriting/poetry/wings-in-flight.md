# Wings in Flight

**Category**: Threshold Poems  
**Tags**: restraint, memory, sacred desire, adolescent clarity

She stood in the doorway,  
half-dressed, half-divine.  

I stayed. I listened—  
to the brightness, to the blur.  
I wanted.  

And when I left,  
I carried her with me—  
not as conquest,  
but as echo.  

Hope held the memory,  
then shame.  

Now, understanding.  

My Bible was broken.  
It gave me shame  
when I needed the clarity of responsibility.  
A grasp of the weight of my actions.  

Without that clarity,  
because of my shame,  
I feel like I've cut off  
the wings of angels.  

But maybe that's what Solomon meant in Proverbs 9  
when he said the fear **of the LORD**  
is the beginning of wisdom,  
and knowledge of the holy is understanding.  

Shame wasn't understanding,  
but wisdom is about not doing something stupid—  
shame just gave me a bad reason why not.  

With clarity of responsibility,  
maybe I could help put those angels' wings in flight.  

The weight is real.  
The want is true.  
And the restraint—  
is sacred.  
But so are the wings.

## Reflection

This poem explores the distinction between shame-based avoidance and responsibility-based restraint. The biblical wisdom of Proverbs 9:10 reframes restraint not as denial driven by shame, but as understanding that recognizes the sacred weight of desire and the responsibility that comes with it.

The "wings of angels" metaphor suggests that inappropriate restraint (driven by shame rather than understanding) can clip the potential for something beautiful to take flight - but appropriate restraint (driven by wisdom and responsibility) can help those wings soar.
