# HarmonyWriting Space

**Personal creative writing, poetry, and reflective works**

## Purpose

The HarmonyWriting space houses creative and personal writings by the repository owner, including:
- Poetry exploring themes of restraint, memory, and spiritual growth
- Reflective prose on lived experience
- Threshold writings that bridge personal narrative and theological insight

## Directory Structure

### `/poetry/`
Personal poems including:
- Threshold poems about adolescent experience and sacred restraint
- Reflections on biblical wisdom and lived application
- Works exploring the intersection of desire, responsibility, and understanding

## Attribution

All works in this space are authored by good4usoul-caene unless otherwise noted in individual file headers.

## Context

This space represents the personal voice within the broader cosmological-canon Temple - a place where individual experience, spiritual reflection, and creative expression find their home alongside more formal theological and hermeneutical works.
