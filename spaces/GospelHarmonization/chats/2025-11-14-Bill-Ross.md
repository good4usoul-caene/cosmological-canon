## Luke’s Fire Glyph: Ambiguity and Judgment (Major)

**Harmony Note:**  
Luke 12:49–53 presents Jesus as bringing “fire upon the land” and yearning for its ignition.  
Traditional readings, as highlighted by Bill Ross, treat this fire as apocalyptic judgment and temple destruction—a motif of wrath rooted in Deuteronomy.  
The baptism is crucifixion; division follows, not peace.

**Interpretive Discord:**  
Jonathan Doolin critiques the narrative structure, treating Luke’s account as “lukewarm” (Rev 3:16), characterized by spiritual redirection rather than correction.  
Truth, in this model, is sometimes bypassed for the sake of mercy or Spirit.  
The story of the Good Samaritan crystallizes the ambiguity: all are neighbors, but the answer focuses only on mercy, not fact.

**Temperature Model (Glyph):**
- HOT — Matthew 25:41–46: Judgment is direct, mercy is command, failure leads to fiery punishment.
- COLD — John 3:16–18: Salvation as naming; the name inscribed in Sheol, cold and inert, requiring more than invocation.
- LUKEWARM — Luke’s fire is ambiguous, mixing warning, division, and incomplete correction.

**Canon Seed:**  
Let “fire” become a narrative glyph—sometimes judgment, sometimes a searchlight on ambiguity.  
Let the temperature of covenant shape the fate of characters:  
  - Hot: decisive, merciful, unforgiving  
  - Cold: inscribed, inert, silent  
  - Lukewarm: ambiguous, trickster, open to redirection

**In Luke 12:49, why was Jesus anxious to start the fire in the Land?**

With another wisdom, to see, hear, understand, and be healedTue
In Luke 12:49, why was Jesus anxious to start the fire in the Land?

🔥 Luke 12:49—“I came to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!”

I think it was a metaphorical fire—the fire of ideas 💡. Jesus knew the world wasn’t ready for his teaching. Not completely.

His message embraced nonviolence and radical love 💖. Those who followed it completely would become very vulnerable in a world ruled by violence and monopoly 🏛️. He advised them to be as innocent as doves 🕊️ and as wise as snakes 🐍, to navigate a hostile world without compromising the integrity of love.

When the fire is fully kindled, the spark of radical love should go out across the whole world 🌍. There will no longer be a need for war ⚔️, and the poor will have dignity 🤲. This aligns with prophetic hopes from Isaiah and Amos—not just the absence of conflict, but the presence of equity ⚖️.

The fire is not destructive but *refining*—burning away injustice, hypocrisy, and apathy 🔥.

In the very next verse (Luke 12:50), Jesus says, “But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed!” 😔 His suffering fulfills the requirements of previous prophets, acknowledged by the Jewish tradition as necessary for messianic legitimacy 📜.

Especially, I think, the requirements that:

- The Son of Man be punished for any sin he fails to warn people about (Ezekiel 3:17–21) ⚠️

- The blood of the lamb be splashed over the doorway ✝️ of non-Jews so that God will pass them over (Exodus 12) 🩸🚪

Disclaimer: I don’t speak for any sect.

Here is the immediate context:

[Luk 12:49-50 NASB95] [49] "I have come to cast fire upon the earth; and how I wish it were already kindled! [50] "But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!

So:

“I have come to cast fire upon the Land” - refers to the destruction of Jerusalem and the complete and final end of 2nd Temple Judaism that occurred c.70ad/ce:
[Deu 32:21-25 NASB95] [21] 'They have made Me jealous with [what] is not God; They have provoked Me to anger with their idols. So I will make them jealous with [those who] are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation, [22] For a fire is kindled in My anger, And burns to the lowest part of Sheol, And consumes the earth with its yield, And sets on fire the foundations of the mountains. [23] 'I will heap misfortunes on them; I will use My arrows on them. [24] '[They will be] wasted by famine, and consumed by plague And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, With the venom of crawling things of the dust. [25] 'Outside the sword will bereave, And inside terror-- Both young man and virgin, The nursling with the man of gray hair.
“I wish it was already kindled” - Jesus was looking forward to destroying Jerusalem, whom he considered the enemies of God:
[Deu 32:34-36, 41-43 NASB95] [34] 'Is it not laid up in store with Me, Sealed up in My treasuries? [35] 'Vengeance is Mine, and retribution, In due time their foot will slip; For the day of their calamity is near, And the impending things are hastening upon them.' [36] "For the LORD will vindicate His people, And will have compassion on His servants, When He sees that [their] strength is gone, And there is none [remaining,] bond or free. ... [41] If I sharpen My flashing sword, And My hand takes hold on justice, I will render vengeance on My adversaries, And I will repay those who hate Me. [42] 'I will make My arrows drunk with blood, And My sword will devour flesh, With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the long-haired leaders of the enemy.' [43] "Rejoice, O nations, [with] His people; For He will avenge the blood of His servants, And will render vengeance on His adversaries, And will atone for His land [and] His people."
“But I have a baptism to undergo” - before the fun would begin, Jesus would have to be crucified:
[Mar 10:38-39 NASB95] [38] But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?" [39] They said to Him, "We are able." And Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized.
“I’m very distressed and will be until it is accomplished” - Jesus expressed great anxiety about his upcoming ordeal:
[Mar 14:32-37 RSV] [32] And they went to a place which was called Gethsem'ane; and he said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray." [33] And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. [34] And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch." [35] And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. [36] And he said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt." [37] And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?
In the next passage he denies the idea that he came to bring peace when in reality he came to wreak so much havoc that it would break up families:

[Luk 12:51-53 NASB95] [51] "Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division; [52] for from now on five [members] in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three. [53] "They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."

Jonathan - Luke is Compromised
---
 · Wed
Bill, I notice you’re quoting Luke a lot. But you’re not really reading the text and getting a sense of the author’s flexibility with truth. "John could see the problems with Luke, and even invented a word for Luke’s wishy-washiness when it came to truth: So because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth."

As an example, there’s a problematic story called “The Good Samaritan”. In Luke 10:36, Jesus asks an expert in the law “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor” The expert says “The one who had mercy on him”. Now, clearly, if you have any alignment with truth at all, you realize the answer is not correct. The answer is that all three of the men are neighbors. However, Luke has Jesus bypass the correction of truth, and focuses only on the Holy Spirit, saying “Then go and do likewise”.

But since Luke does not dedicate himself to the Spirit of Truth in “The Good Samaritan”, I have doubts that he dedicates himself to the Spirit of Truth in other passages. As such, when Luke says that Jesus has come to bring disagreement, that’s something for Luke to hear. Since Luke is not committed to truth, Jesus is bringing disagreement to people like Luke.



Bill Ross - Overcoming Jewish Hate of Samaritans

 · Wed
Luke’s Jesus is making the point that the Judeans should not decide whom they should love as they do themselves on the basis of being of the same religion. Instead they must love all that are merciful as they love themselves.

[Jhn 4:9 NASB95] [9] Therefore the Samaritan woman said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)

Might I suggest that you should take your finger off the trigger of accusations until you have at least conferred with others, in case you are missing something?

Jonathan Doolin - Spirit of Truth vs. Holy Spirit
---
 · Wed
Bill, I appreciate your effort to highlight the compassion embedded in Luke’s parable. But I’m not critiquing the Samaritan’s mercy—I’m critiquing Luke’s narrative structure and its failure to correct a false answer.

The question Jesus asks is:

“Which of these three do you think was a neighbor?”

The expert replies:

“The one who showed mercy.”

But that’s not the correct answer. The correct answer is:

“All three are neighbors.”

Luke’s Jesus does not correct the expert. He bypasses the moment of truth and says, “Go and do likewise.” That’s a spiritual redirection, not a correction. And when truth is bypassed, the Spirit of Truth is not honored.

You say I’m pulling the trigger of accusation. I say I’m naming a fracture. So I ask you plainly:

What accusation have I made? I’ve questioned Luke’s fidelity to truth. That’s not slander—it’s discernment.

If we are to love all who show mercy, then we must also love those who fail to show it. And we must love truth enough to say when it’s been evaded.

Bill Ross - Truth does not matter, so long as point is interesting
---
 · Wed
Ok, so you don’t approve of the structure he opted for, but he got an interesting point across with it so I’m okay with it.

Possibly tangentially related:

[Mat 25:41-46 NASB95] [41] "Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels; [42] for I was hungry, and you gave Me [nothing] to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink; [43] I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.' [44] "Then they themselves also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?' [45] "Then He will answer them, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.' [46] "These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."

Jonathan Doolin - Hot/Cold/Lukewarm diagnostic based on Realms of Life and Sheol.

 · 19h
🔥 I. Temperature Glyphs: Covenant and Consequence

🔄 Revelation 3:16 — Lukewarm Rebuke Spewed from the mouth. Neither hot nor cold. A warning to those who dwell in inert invocation.
🔥 Matthew 25:41–46 is FULLY HOT. Judgment without ambiguity. Mercy as command. Those who fail the least WILL GO to eternal punishment. NOT eternal rest.
❄️ John 3:16–18 is FULLY COLD. The name of Jesus stored in Sheol. Belief without embodiment. No wisdom, no work, no transformation.
🕳️ II. Sheol as the Realm of Inert Covenant (FULLY COLD)

📜 Isaiah 28:15–18 (NASB): A covenant with death, a pact with Sheol—false security that will be trampled. The scourge doesn’t just punish—it reveals terror in the failure to understand.
🙏 Psalm 6:5 (NASB): “In Sheol, who will give You thanks?” Sheol is not rebellion—it’s absence. No praise, no memory, no communion.
🧠 Ecclesiastes 9:5–10 (NASB): The dead know nothing. Their love, hate, and jealousy vanish. In Sheol, there is no work, no planning, no knowledge, no wisdom.
❄️ John 3:16–18 is FULLY COLD. It has "the name of the only begotten son" stored in a dark, silent, inert realm. Among the dead, the name of the only begotten son only appears as an inscription. Not a lived experience of meaning. There is no work or thought or knowledge of wisdom in it (Ecclesiastes 9:10). John 3:16–18 is FULLY COLD. So when John says in Revelation "because you are neither hot or cold, [God] will spew you from your mouth," he does not mean John.
🧠 III. Luke’s Lukewarm Structure and the Risk of Misreading

🧩 I classify Luke's "Good Samaritan" story as Luke-Warm because Jesus does not correct the teacher-of-the-law on who is his neighbor.
🧠 Jesus's final words are "Go and do likewise," which say "Act as the Good Samaritan."
❓ However, the way the conversation plays out leaves the definition of "Who is my neighbor" ambiguous.
🎭 Jesus asks a TRICK question, "Which ONE of these three is your neighbor," and the teacher-of-the-law, led astray by the trick question, answers "The one who showed mercy."
❌ That is not correct. The one who showed mercy is the one who should be emulated, but even the ones that passed by without providing help are still neighbors.
🙌 Now, I'm not saying that Luke got this wrong. If the Messiah asks trick questions, he had his reasons.
📣 Jesus laments miscommunication in John 15:22: "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin."
🔥 Matthew 25:41–46, though, doesn't have the ambiguity. It is FULLY HOT, and it invokes authority over Sheol's realm, saying that those who do not treat the poor with dignity and respect WILL GO to eternal punishment. NOT eternal rest. This is consistent with the claims of Isaiah 28:15–18.
⚖️ IV. Matthew 7:21–23 — The Final Glyph

🗣️ Matthew 7:21–23 makes clear that John 3:16–18 is not enough.
✋ “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom… but only the one who does the will of my Father.”
✅ This is the final glyph: naming without doing is not enough. The covenant must be lived, not just spoken.
💧 Those who invoke “Jesus” without embodying his command—especially mercy to the least—are told, “I never knew you.”
🌍 Matthew 7:21–23 does not limit itself to people who have the name of Jesus Christ on their lips either.
🕊️ It opens up the possibility of heaven on earth, and eternal life in heaven even to those who refuse to acknowledge Jesus as Messiah, or have never heard his name.
🕊️ V. Personal Glyph of Mortal Gratitude

🌅 Now, as for me, eternal rest is sufficient.
🙏 I'm happy to live out my mortal life to the best of my ability, and appreciate whatever time God has given me.
⚠️ For Christians demanding eternal life, though, they should be cautious about the warnings of Jesus in Matthew 25:41–46, and the warnings of Isaiah 28:15–18.
🚫 VI. Rebuke of Projection

🙏 If Christians feel they NEED eternal life in heaven, I have no objection.
❗ But they should also constrain themselves from the notion that atheists or Jews want eternal life.
⚔️ This is a violence of projection.
🧭 Not everyone wants what you want.
🧱 Not everyone fears what you fear.
🕳️ And not everyone is bound by your covenant with death.

Bill Ross - Authorship claim
---
 · 19h
“Luke” wrote most of the NT. Do you have as much disdain for the other half? Or are you just apoplectic over Luke?

Jonathan Doolin - Authorship hypothesis
---
 · 19h
Bill, your comment, arriving seven minutes after my post, seems to reflect an immediate reaction rather than a deeper engagement with the distinctions I’ve laid out—such as hot, cold, and lukewarm covenant, the difference between naming and doing, and Sheol as a realm of absence. Your response appears to reduce the nuance of my discernment into a binary of approval or disdain, which wasn’t my intent.

While I would acknowledge your claim that Luke wrote most of the New Testament as your leading hypothesis, it doesn't match my own. I think there were four men, and probably more, involved in writing the gospels.

Matthew was actually acknowledged as a tax collector who traveled with Jesus.
John is acknowledged as being one of the disciples of Jesus.
Mark and Luke if I recall correctly, are not mentioned by name as disciples so they may have come on board later—not as direct witnesses, but to fill out some requirement (a commonly held interpretation of prophecy, perhaps) that there must be four gospels.
This notion is my "leading hypothesis" now, but that could quickly change with a presentation of scriptural or historical evidence.

But importantly, I don't make judgment on any text based on where it came from, but based on its fruits. I don't care that there is manure in the soil if the fruit feeds me. And whether one or twenty men or women wrote the gospels, it has no effect on words within them.

I am not apoplectic over Luke. Rather, I find some delight in his ambiguities. But also, I spew these ambiguities out of my mouth, along with the lighting fire of clarification.

And if you’re open to it, I’d love to hear your thoughts on the covenant temperatures I’ve outlined.

Bill Ross - Fulfillment of Prophecy as "Arrangement by God"
---
 · 18h
So you think that Luke’s “Luke-warmness” is arranged by God, so the various gospels form a sort of rainbow, like the notion that each of the seven assemblies of Revelation represent a different period of history? I’m asking because I don’t want to mistake what you are saying.

Jonathan Doolin - Fulfillment of Prophecy by careful decisions
---
 · 17h
From Daniel 7:2–8, we have:

🦁 Lion with eagle’s wings — Matthew presents Jesus as royal (Lion) and divinely sanctioned (Eagle’s wings).

His genealogy, fulfillment of prophecy, and kingdom parables all point to Messiah as King.

The wings may also suggest ascent—Matthew ends with the Great Commission, lifting the gospel skyward.

🐻 Bear raised on one side — Mark is the shortest gospel, often seen as a condensed version of Matthew, emphasizing action over discourse.

The “one side” may symbolize partial revelation—Mark shows one flank of the gospel beast, stripped of genealogy or birth narrative.

The bear’s raw strength matches Mark’s urgency and immediacy: “Immediately… immediately…”

🐆 Leopard with four wings and four heads — Greece

Luke’s gospel is expansive, literary, and layered.

The four heads may represent four narrative Jesuses:

• The prophetic Jesus of Isaiah

• The compassionate healer

• The political disruptor

• The post-resurrection revealer

The four wings suggest speed and reach—Luke’s gospel flies across boundaries: gender, ethnicity, class.

🐉 Terrifying beast with iron teeth and ten horns — In John 10, Jesus says: “I am the gate.”

The gate has iron clarity—those who do not enter through it are thieves.

John’s Jesus is cosmic, judicial, and dividing: light vs. darkness, truth vs. lies.

The ten horns may not be literal, but by John 10, the gospel has established tenfold authority—a fullness of judgment and sovereignty.

📜 And yes, the seven angels and the seven churches in the seven assemblies may represent different periods of history,

or it might be that the text is aimed at future philosophers and prophets.

🕊️ For me, I hear the clarion call to the angel of the church of Thyatira.

Jesus has the one problem with me: that I tolerate Jezebel.

Jezebel did something that I would not tolerate if I had the choice.

She orchestrated false testimony against Naboth.

And in so doing, she tricked Elijah into bringing false charges against Ahab.

I won't willingly tolerate anyone breaking the ninth commandment.

Even when Elijah broke it through error, it is not tolerable.

🧱 However, the matter is one of historical and/or scriptural record.

To say "I cannot tolerate" is to refuse complicity, even retroactively.

It's a declaration that this act, though completed, remains outside the bounds of covenant.

I will not pretend it was harmless, justified, or forgettable.

🕊️ But I must also "forgive others."

This is a release.

Forgiveness does not require tolerance.

Truth first: acknowledge the wound, name it, and choose not to carry vengeance.

But if the act is still being justified, repeated, or denied, forgiveness without truth becomes erasure.

🌿 Now as far as Jezebel's participation at the table of Asherah,

I would note that none of the prophets of Asherah were executed by Elijah—only the prophets of Baal.

He tolerated the prophets of Asherah when they abandoned Baal and converted to follow YHWH.

I would go further and celebrate them.

🌟 As for the gifts that Revelation promises to the angel of Thyatira,

I will not replace grace for grace already given.

You’ve named my faith dead, Bill.
But I won’t return the gesture.

And I will not tolerate false testimony—about Naboth, about Jesus, or about me.

You are not required to shout every truth.
But if the lie is still being told, and the harm still unfolding, then silence may be mistaken for consent.

I feel, in your original post, you are not defending Jesus,
but repeating: “Jesus was looking forward to destroying Jerusalem, whom he considered the enemies of God”—
the accusation that got him crucified in the first place.

Jesus offered no defense of this accusation.
He allowed what had to happen to happen.
But to my eye, there is not sufficient evidence to crucify him.

When the Advocate comes, he will stand alone. He will prove the world wrong about sin, because they do not know who is speaking in John 16. They are wrong about righteousness, because it was the speaker in John 16 who went to his Father in Heaven. They are wrong about judgment, because Jesus of Nazareth stands condemned.

I have much more to say to you, but it’s apparently more than you can bear at the moment.
