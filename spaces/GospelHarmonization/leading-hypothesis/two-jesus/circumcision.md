# 🔍 Circumcision Analysis - Two Jesus Hypothesis

## 📋 Overview

In an exchange on Quora with Bill Ross, the question arose of whether Galations 2:20 in regards to Christian's "Crucifixion with Christ" was metaphorical or metaphysical.  While I don't think that crucifixion WITH Christ is metaphysical, I do believe that the Christian belief in Jesus on the Cross as "The Way" or "a door" has a metaphysical aspect to it.  But I believe the metaphysics of concern in Galatians 2:20 are primarily about circumcision, rather than crucifixion.

## ❓ Q1: In Galatians 2:19–20, is Paul speaking metaphysically or metaphorically?

**🗣️ A1:**  
Bill, you already know my theory—that Jesus of Nazareth wasn’t crucified.  
So when Paul says, “I have been crucified with Christ,” we have to ask: *which Christ?*  

Paul’s persecution of the Christians didn’t end with a miracle—it ended with a contradiction. He met living men he thought were dead. If he encountered Ananias alive, and possibly Jesus of Nazareth himself, then his Damascus moment wasn’t metaphysical—it was genre collapse.  

That’s why I read Galatians 2:20 as **metaphorical**, not metaphysical. Paul is describing the death of his old framework—his law, his cynicism, his false witness. He’s not mystically united with a cosmic Christ; he’s surrendering to the truth he once denied.  

The metaphysical fulfillment belongs to Jesus of Nazareth. When Barabbas died, his blood splashed upon the Nazarene, who became the **doorway of Exodus 12:7**—the one marked by blood, through whom the firstborn are spared.  

And when Jesus healed Malchus’s ear, he wasn’t just restoring flesh—he was **healing the requirement of Exodus 12:48**. Circumcision, once a barrier to communion, was ritually undone.  

Paul may have tried to speak metaphysically, but he missed the mark. The true metaphysics of Jesus is not to be crucified with him, but to **believe in him**.  

And belief, Bill—not ritual—is the doorway.  

As for the disciples, when they died, their deaths were not metaphorical, nor metaphysical.  
**They were quite literal.**  
And that, too, is a testimony.

## ❓ Q2: So would you say Galatians 2:19–20 is metaphysical or metaphoric?

**🗣️ A2:**  
Bill, to me, the primary issue in Galatians 2 isn’t verse 20 in isolation—it’s the deeper question: *Must Christians be circumcised to be saved?*  

The most relevant verses aren’t Pauline at all. They’re in **Exodus 12**:  
- 🩸 **Verse 7**: Blood on the doorpost protects the firstborn.  
- ✂️ **Verse 48**: No uncircumcised male may eat the Passover.  

This is the tension Paul is navigating. And I believe the gospel writers encode its resolution in the garden.  

In **John 18:10**, Peter cuts off the ear of Malchus. But the metaphysical key lies in **Matthew 26:51–52**, **Luke 22:51**, and **Mark 14:48**. The *ear* is symbolic of the *foreskin*. When Jesus says, “Put your sword back in its place,” and “No more of this,” he’s not just ending violence—he’s ending circumcision as a requirement.  

As for me, I don’t think of Jesus of Nazareth as a figure to be crucified with. I see him as **“the way”**—a **doorway**.  

Another metaphysical connection appears in **John 19:29–30**. Why does Jesus say “It is finished” after drinking wine vinegar? Because that same wine vinegar had earlier touched the blood-soaked face of **Jesus Barabbas**. When the stalk of hyssop reaches Jesus of Nazareth, he becomes—metaphysically—the **door of Exodus 12:7**.  

The blood of the lamb has touched the door. And those who believe in that door are marked—not for death, but for protection.  

So when Paul says, “I have been crucified with Christ,” I believe he’s speaking **metaphorically**. It could also be **literal**, given how many have died for their testimony. But **metaphysically**, Christians are not called to die with Jesus.  
We are called to **believe in him**.  
To walk through the door.  
To follow *the way*.

## ❓ Q3: Follow-up on Cephas in Galatians 2 and the cutting of Malchus’s ear

**🗣️ A3:**  
Bill, one more note—because I think it matters.  

The **Cephas** Paul confronts in Galatians 2 seems quite likely to me to be the same **Cephas** introduced in **John 1**, where Jesus Barabbas names him “Simon Peter.” This is **Simon Pether**—*Hearing Peter*—the one who, in **John 18:10**, cuts off the ear of Malchus *(distinct from Peter, who testified that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah, on whose rock the church is built)*.  

That act, I believe, is more than historical detail. It’s a **metaphysical glyph**. The **ear**, symbolically, is the **foreskin**. And the blade Peter wields is not just a weapon—it’s the **ritual knife of circumcision**.  

So when Jesus says, “Put your sword back in its place,” he’s not only ending violence—he’s rejecting the blade of ritual law. He’s healing the wound of circumcision itself.  

In that light, Cephas’s later behavior in Galatians—drawing back from Gentiles, fearing the circumcision group—mirrors his earlier act.  
He’s still wielding the blade.  
**Still hearing peters.**  

And Paul, to his credit, calls him out.  

So when we read Galatians 2:20, we’re not just reading Paul’s metaphor. We’re watching a **ritual confrontation** between two men—one who still cuts, and one who has laid down the knife.

## 🎯 Implications

- If Jewish people ever accept Jesus of Nazareth as a Messiah, they must also accept
   - (1) that he has the authority to remove the restriction of circumcision from Exodus 12
   - (2) That a belief in Jesus on the cross suffices as having blood of the lamb on the doorway for passover requirement from Exodus 2
   - (3) That when Christians are crucified as an aspect of their trials for believing in the Messiah, this should be treated as regrettable, rather than as prerogative.
   - (4) The belief in Jesus on the cross is a glyph of protection--not against eternal hell, but against the rules of Exodus 12.
