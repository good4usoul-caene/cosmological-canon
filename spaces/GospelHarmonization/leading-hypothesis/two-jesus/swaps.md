📖 Gospel of John – Swap Sequence

This act is interpreted as the kiss.
The following four chapters are Barabbas’s prayers, heard and recorded by John after his captivity.

John 20
Contains two near-blasphemies.
Fictionalized words attributed to Barabbas.

Possibly Jesus of Nazareth, who did not die.
📜 Gospel of Matthew – Swap Sequence

Dual Scene (Matthew 26)
Jesus of Nazareth weeps regular tears.
Jesus Barabbas sheds literal blood from circumcision.
Narrative primarily follows Jesus Barabbas until crucifixion.
Swap (Matthew 27)
Nicodemus arrives alone.
Takes the weakened Jesus of Nazareth to a tomb.
Matthew continues to follow Jesus of Nazareth without detours.
He trusts the women who say to find Jesus atop the mountain in Galilee.
🔄 The Shuffle – Composite Scene Across Gospels

Interviews
Jesus of Nazareth is interviewed by Annas (outside).
Jesus Barabbas is interviewed by Caiaphas (inside).
Robes and Recognition
Jesus of Nazareth is dressed twice: once by Herod, once by Pilate.
Robes resemble Odysseus’s disguise.
Pilate presents Barabbas in common robes and Jesus of Nazareth as Odysseus.
Crowd and Beating
Crowd chooses to release Barabbas.
Pilate sends both men into a circle of guards.
Barabbas’s face is beaten until unrecognizable.
Robe is placed on Barabbas, who is taken to crucifixion.
Final Crucifixion
Hours later, Jesus of Nazareth is brought before the priests at the Stone Pavement.
He is crucified with instructions that his skin not be pierced (no nails).
He is the only one identified as “the Nazarene” in all four Gospels.
He hangs on the cross surrounded by the Marys.
One witness claims he was impaled by a spear—insufficient under Jewish law to establish guilt.
🪶 Heuristic Summary

“Track the swaps. Name the Nazarene. Follow the robe. Trust the women. Question the spear.”

🪶 Heuristic Addendum: The Maher-Shalal Hash-Baz Threshold (John 20:3–6)

Scene: Mary Magdalene reports the empty tomb.
John (the beloved disciple) runs ahead—he rushes to the spoils but does not enter.
Peter arrives second but enters first—a gesture of apostolic authority.
John enters after and believes, marking a shift in narrative authority.
🔍 Interpretive Note

In the Two Jesus Hypothesis, this moment may signal John’s final narrative alignment with Barabbas, whose body he has just witnessed buried. As Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, John becomes the seer of aftermath, the one who records the spoils of a broken body and the echo of a spirit that moves beyond death.

# Exact words:
Can you help me organize this "Bare Minimum Heuristics for Two Jesus Hypothesis" Sure, let's revisit the swaps, first in john. Scene: Jesus barabbas puts a morsel in judas mouth. This is the kiss. For four chapters, these are the prayers of barabbas, heard and recorded by john, after his captivity. Scene: swap: Jesus of nazareth crosses the kidron valley, sees judas circumcizing Jesus barabbas. Identifies himself as Jesus of nazareth. John follows Jesus of nazareth until next swap, when Joseph of arimathea joins Nicodemus to collect the corpse of Jesus barabbas. Immediately swap back. John 20 is the two near-blasphemies, a fictional account of the words of barabbas. Chapter 21, the Spirit of Jesus is acknowledged in another man (possibly Jesus of nazareth, who didn't die) questions? Looks right, thanks. Now Matthew. Swap 1: dual scene, when Jesus weeps tears like blood, Jesus of nazareth weeps regular tears. Jesus barabbas sheds literal blood from his circumcision. Story mostly follows Jesus barabbas until he dies on the cross. Swap when Nicodemus arrives by himself, taking the weakened Jesus of nazareth to a tomb. Matthew continues to follow Jesus of nazareth, and doesn't take any detours. Matthew trusts the women who say to find Jesus on top of the mountain in galilee. Okay, we should do one more inscription: the shuffle. Both Nazarene and barabbas are interviewed. One by annas outside, and the other by caiaphas inside. In the morning, Jesus of nazareth is dressed twice, once by herod, and once by pilate. The overlapping robes resemble odysseus. Pilate brings barabbas in common robes and nazarene as odysseus before the crowd. Crowd sets barabbas free, but pilate sends both men into a circle of guards who beat barabbas' face until it can't be identified. Robe is put on barabbas, then he is taken to his crucifixion. Hours later, nazarene is brought before head priests, at the stone Pavement. The nazarene is crucified with instruction that his skin is not to be pierced. (No nails) He is the only one identified as the nazarene in the four gospels. He hangs on the cross, surrounded by the Mary's. One witness claims he was impaled by a spear (which is not sufficient under Jewish law to establish guilt)

Perfect except one mistake I made. I don't think that the end of John 19 swaps back to Jesus of Nazareth.

Actually, hmm. when does John claim that he reaches the tomb before Peter, but Peter goes in?

Yes, it's a narrative hand-off. This is where John takes on his role of Maher Shalal Hash Baz when John "rushes to the spoils"

This looks really good, (one final edit at end of John 19)
