What is the significance of the repeated emphasis on worship in Revelation 13 when discussing the "mark of the beast"?

The mark of the second beast to which John is referring echoes a ritual from Ezekiel. Ezekiel was tasked with cooking his food—perhaps a metaphor for his testimony—over dung, and prophesying over a toy model of Jerusalem. His role was to dramatize the consequences of violating Torah law, even when those laws condemned acts that, by modern ethical standards, are harmless or even affirming. These included praying while facing the sunrise, painting murals to educate about bugs, smelling plant roots to appreciate creation, and mourning Tammuz—a celebration of myth and ancient rites.

In Ezekiel’s vision, a man in linen applies a mark to those who lament these acts. But this is not a protective glyph—it’s a glyph of fear, a ritual of false agreement. To lament beauty, curiosity, and myth is to claim a lie is true. Those who refused to participate in this lamentation were massacred, and their blood was smeared around the temple—likely enacted by Ezekiel’s hands upon the toy model. This round-up not only killed the unmarked, it also excluded them from the social economy, preventing them from buying or selling—just as Revelation 13 describes.

Revelation 13 intensifies this ritual logic. The second beast “causes all… to receive a mark on their right hand or forehead,” and “no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark” (Revelation 13:16–17). This mark is not a barcode—it’s a liturgical seal, a token of worship. The beast demands reverence, and the mark is the price of participation.

The number of the beast may be extrapolated from Ezekiel’s timestamp: 6/6/5. The name of the beast is likely the “idol of jealousy,” described as hanging south of the temple entryway—possibly a stylized model or literal bull’s “horn.” The placement suggests a fertility cult or a parody of divine endowment. However, the ambiguity is sufficient to allow interpretations that the speaker is the god of the Jews, rather than the idol of jealousy.

The climax comes in Revelation 14:9–10:

> “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand, he too will drink of the wine of God’s wrath…”

This "wine" may be the issuance from the idol of jealousy. Those unworthy of the water of life are instead fit to receive the torrent of wrath—perhaps even the runoff of bull urine, poured out into the basin of death.
