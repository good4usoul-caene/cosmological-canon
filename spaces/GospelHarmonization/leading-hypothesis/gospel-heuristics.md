Leading hypothesis on interpretive principles for gospel texts.

---

## Inspiration Source

*Inspired by a Facebook conversation with Lydia McGrew regarding Dale Allison's interpretation of Matthew 28:18.*

## Core Heuristic Hypothesis: Gospel Recognition Thresholds

The post-resurrection appearances across the Gospels function as **thresholds of recognition** rather than simple chronological events. Each gospel presents a different mechanism by which Jesus' spirit is identified, attributed, or transferred.

### Four Recognition Patterns:

**Matthew 28**: Recognition through **communal witness**. The women's testimony leads disciples to the appointed mountain in Galilee. Jesus' declaration of authority occurs on earth, not from an ascended position. The mountain represents the summit of narrative authority—where Jesus said he would be found.

**Luke 24 (Emmaus)**: Recognition through **ritual gesture**. Jesus remains unrecognized until the breaking of bread—a moment where spirit is revealed through symbolic action rather than visual identification.

**Mark 16**: Recognition through **form ambiguity**. Jesus appears "in another form," suggesting the spirit may manifest through different vessels—a genre signal of multiplicity.

**John 20-21**: Recognition through **delayed identification**. From "do not hold me" (ascension pending) to the miraculous catch (recognition through communal experience), these scenes hint at spirit transference and symbolic recognition.

## Two Interpretive Rubrics

**Rubric of Truth**: Only allowing interpretations I am genuinely capable of believing, grounded in evidence and consistency.

**Rubric of Faith**: Seeking interpretations that inspire hope rather than dread, while maintaining intellectual honesty.

## Central Thesis

The gospel writers inscribed inconsistencies with purpose—not due to error, but to convey sacred truth through different gestures, settings, and sequences. The question "Why are these stories different?" unlocks their meaning as complementary rather than contradictory accounts.

Rather than flattening these texts into simple timelines, we should honor their genre, gestures, and mythic resonance while maintaining that only one history actually occurred.

## The Two Ladders Framework

Building on Heraclitean wisdom that "the way up is the way down," I propose two complementary paths of interpretation:

**The Ladder of Truth**: Climbed through evidence, consistency, and logical analysis—seeking what genuinely can be believed.

**The Ladder of Holiness**: Climbed through repentance, forgiveness, and spiritual discernment—seeking what inspires hope and transformation.

## Mountain vs. Wilderness

Jesus' warning in Matthew 24:26—"If they say I am in the wilderness or in a secret room, do not believe them"—is not merely geographic but genre-coded. The wilderness signals isolation or deception; secret rooms suggest hidden agendas. 

But the mountain in Matthew 28 represents something different: a place of revelation, communal trust, and ritual recognition. It's where Jesus said he would be found—and where he is discovered by those who believe the women's testimony.

The mountain is not the wilderness. It is the summit of narrative authority.

## Methodological Notes

This approach acknowledges that apologetics often ends up "apologizing for the text"—treating scripture's plain language as too dangerous to trust. Instead, I propose engaging directly with what the text says, asking why gospel writers chose different narrative strategies to convey the same sacred truth.

The inconsistencies demand careful acknowledgment and the question: "Why are these stories different?" In that asking, the narrative unfolds not into chaos, but into a beautiful, purposeful whole.
